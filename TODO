What we want to do in the following versions
(also see Bug Tracker which includes that info)

  1.2  Add effects
  1.3  Add monsters
  1.4  Add soft columns



Changes request:

 0) Timer feature between turns. Some sort of window poping up. [same as point 14]

 0.5) Separate effects window.

 0.6) Add custom icons.

 0.7) Add heads-up display...

 1) NEW FEATURE: look into a Live CD Turn Watcher version; if
    it is doable, we may gain many more clients who would otherwise
    not want to replace their Win98 with Linux (best choice but we
    cannot force our customers to take it...)

 2) CRASH:

	Clean all characters
	Create 1 character
	Start
	Delete that 1 character
	Next
	Crash

 3) Help menu -- once we have monsters in HTML, we should add a link to it

 4) Make the software work under Win98

 5) The Import dialog came up with no filter at first. Now
    that I selected one, it comes back with that one filter.

    It looks like whenever you change folder, the filter
    selection gets lost. This is certainly a gdk bug, ideas?

    [Reported by Eric?]

 6) The menu separators are missing under MS-Windows (A Gtk
    problem?) They are added to the <xml> string but nothing
    appears.


 8) Fix the .turnwatcher1 known file type extension in Win32
    so it is visible right away once the install finishes.
    (Also, implement that feature in KDE/Gnome)

 9) Automate the license.cpp generation (we have a script, it should
    be called by the Makefile.am whenever the source doc/LICENSE.txt
    file changes)

9.5) NEW FEATURE: Add abilities and modifiers. Support temp hit points.

10) NEW FEATURE: manually adding the initiative (i.e. force
    the initiative order so people can still throw dice but
    use the computer in non-ultra initiative for rounds to
    follow and manage the ready/delay and other states)

11) NEW FEATURE: make the Import work with just the selected
    characters/monsters (i.e. need multi-selection!)

12) NEW FEATURE: soft columns, adding new die rolls

13) NEW FEATURE: soft columns where the die/dice rolls is specified
    manually (i.e. 3d8+1) -- this allows us to break from the d20
    only scheme

13) NEW FEATURE: status changed to some sort of effect column
    with information about the effect of spells, poisons, potions,
    scrolls, wands, etc. [adding a new type Effect and add a row
    instead of a column]

14) NEW FEATURE: add a realtime timer so people can easilly know
    whether they are really focusing on the combat rather than
    talking about stuff... We need a start/pause and a way to
    setup the amount of time a round should take. [by Karl]

15) NEW FEATURE: Distinguish between lethal and non lethal damage.

16) NEW FEATURE: Separate initiative modifier into HD + con modifier + feats

17) NEW FEATURE: Allow mass change to modifiers
