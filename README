Formerly under a proprietary license, Turn Watcher has been ported to the GPLv2
and the source is now hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/turnwatcher/

Turn Watcher relies on Gtkmm 2.4, and formerly proprietary libraries molib and motk
from Made to Order Software Corporation (http://www.m2osw.com). Local copies
of molib and motk are now in the repository.

Installation from source:
Turn Watcher requires cmake 2.8+, and g++ 4.6+, in addition to gtkmm 2.4.
Download the software distribution from sourceforge. Create a build folder
and run cmake to generate the makefiles. Then run make.

	$ tar xf turnwatcher-1.5.tar.gz
	$ cd turnwatcher-1.5
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make

The binary will be linked into the bin folder. To run, just type "bin/turnwatcher
from the build folder.

You may also access the tip of the Mercurial codebase. Install Mercurial
on your system if it is not already there, then run this command:

$ hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/turnwatcher/code turnwatcher

Follow the steps above to build from source.
