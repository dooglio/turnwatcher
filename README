NEW!
Now Turn Watcher 1.x has an Ubuntu PPA! To add, just follow the simple steps below:

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:turnwatcher/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install turnwatcher

Or, go here to manually add the sources to your apt sources.list:
https://code.launchpad.net/~turnwatcher/+archive/ppa

Also, the Turn Watcher 1.X code has been merged to lauchpad.net. If you wish to
grab the source for version 1.X, go here:
https://code.launchpad.net/~turnwatcher/turnwatcher/trunk

==============================================================================
Formerly under a proprietary license, Turn Watcher has been ported to the GPLv2
and the source is now hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/turnwatcher/

Turn Watcher relies on Gtkmm 2.4, and formerly proprietary libraries molib and motk
from Made to Order Software Corporation (http://www.m2osw.com). Local copies
of molib and motk are now in the repository.

Installation from source:
Turn Watcher requires cmake 2.8+, and g++ 4.6+, in addition to gtkmm 2.4.
Download the software distribution from sourceforge. Create a build folder
and run cmake to generate the makefiles. Then run make.

	$ tar xf turnwatcher-1.x.tar.gz
	$ cd turnwatcher-1.x
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make

The binary will be linked into the bin folder. To run, just type "bin/turnwatcher
from the build folder.

You may also access the tip of the Mercurial codebase. Install Mercurial
on your system if it is not already there, then run this command:

	$ hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/turnwatcher/code turnwatcher

Note that the Mercurial tip is now in a pre-alpha state, as I am in the process of converting
the UI to Qt4. This will be the 2.0 branch.

If you want code from 1.X instead, install Bazaar and download the code from launchpad.net:

	$ bzr branch lp:turnwatcher

Follow the steps above to build from source.

Happy gaming!
