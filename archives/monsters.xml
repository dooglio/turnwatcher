Caster level 30th; save DC 26 + spell level.</p><p>The save DCs are Charisma-based</p><p><b>Rebuke/Command Undead (Su):</b> Atropals can rebuke or command undead as a cleric with a level equal to the atropal's HD + 6.</p><p><b>Negative Energy Aura (Su):</b> A 30-foot-radius spread negative energy aura spreads from each atropal. All undead in the field (including the atropal) are treated as if having turn resistance +20 and a negative energy version of fast healing 20. Living creatures in the aura are treated as having ten negative levels unless they have some sort of negative energy protection or protection from evil. Creatures with 10 or fewer HD or levels perish (and, at the atropal's option, rise as spectres under the atropal's command 1 minute later).</p><p><b>Constitution Drain (Su):</b> When the atropal hits a living opponent with a touch attack, the opponent takes 5 points of permanent Constitution drain, or 10 points on a critical hit. The atropal heals 20 points of damage, or 40 points on a critical hit, whenever it drains Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. The attack allows a Fortitude save (DC 59). The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> When the atropal hits with a ranged touch attack (a ray of darkness that it shoots from one eye to a range of 400 feet), the resultant energy drain bestows four negative levels, or eight negative levels on a critical hit. For each negative level bestowed on an opponent, the atropal heals 10 points of damage, or 20 on a critical hit, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. After 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 59) for each negative level. If successful, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature; otherwise, the creature's level decreases by one. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Atropals take normal damage from good weapons or sentient weapons (or otherwise living weapons).</p><p><b><i>Summon Nightcrawler</i> (Sp):</b> Five times per day an atropal can summon a nightcrawler.</p><p><b>Abomination Traits:</b> Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.</p><p><b>Undead Traits:</b> Immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less.

  <new-text><p><h2>Dream Larva</h2></p><p>A dream larvas's natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Worst Nightmare (Su):</b> Each time a living creature first views a specific dream larva from a distance of 30 feet or less (or from a scrying effect), the subject sees the image of the most fearsome creature imaginable. This is not an illusion or phantasm; the dream larva truly becomes, for just that instant, the subject's worst nightmare. Even if simultaneously viewed by dozens of different creatures, the dream larva appears differently to each one of them. Creatures immune to fear or mind-affecting effects (or warded by <i>protection from evil</i> or <i>death ward</i> spells) are immune to worst nightmare; all others must make a Will save (DC 43) or die from the supernatural horror revealed. Survivors (and those resurrected) are immune to the effect from that individual dream larva in the future. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>fly</i>,  <i>haste</i>,  <i>nightmare</i>,  <i>prismatic spray</i>; 2/day-<i>dreamscape</i>(epic spell). Caster level 31st; save DC 23 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If the dream larva hits with a claw or pincer, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Dream larvae can use improved grab on a creature of any size. The dream larva has the option to conduct the grapple normally, simply use the claw or pincer to hold the opponent, or use sending (see below) on the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage listed for the attack that established the hold, unless it used sending on the victim.</p><p><b>Sending (Su):</b> Grappled victims may be physically sent into a nightmare, at the dream larva's option, on the dream larva's next action after establishing the grapple. Victims must make a Will save (DC 43) or be apparently swarmed by thousands of worms making up the dream larva's body. The victim is actually cast into a shrieking maelstrom of dream where it can take no actions but observe. The victim physically returns 2d4 rounds later, apparently ejected from the dream larva's body (but appearing even if if the dream larva has left or is otherwise absent). The victim of the nightmare has taken 4d6 points of temporary Wisdom damage, but is otherwise free to act on the round it returns. If the victim takes more Wisdom damage than it has points of Wisdom, the extra points are instead treated as temporary Constitution damage. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b><i>Summon Nightwalker</i> (Sp):</b> Five times per day, a dream larva can summon a nightwalker.</p><p><b>Abomination Traits:</b> Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.</p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Dream larvae take normal damage from good or lawful weapons or weapons forged by a sleepwalking weaponsmith.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

Caster level 21st; save DC 21 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Stasis Touch (Su):</b> As <i>temporal stasis</i>,  except as an at-will supernatural ability. Caster level 25th; save DC 21 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Chronal Blast (Su):</b> As a standard action, the phane can make a ranged touch attack against any creature within 100 feet. If it succeeds, the subject is targeted by a spasm of space-time flux, dealing 15d6 points of damage.</p><p><b>Time Leach (Su):</b> For every round of apparent time experienced by the phane, it automatically absorbs the 'future' from any creature it has successfully encapsulated in static time via its stasis touch (not its null time field), no matter the distance separating victim and phane, and no matter the number of victims. Of course, to the victim no time passes at all, but each apparent round experienced by the phane ages the victim 1d4 years, at the same time healing the phane of 20 hit points of damage. A victim who is not somehow released from static time by a friend who can cast <i>dispel magic</i>,  <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  or some other likely spell, eventually ages to death. Victims killed in this manner automatically fall out of static time as desiccated husks that disintegrate to a fine dust with even the lightest touch. Victims who are released prior to death immediately apply the physical effects of aging, but not the mental effects.</p><p><b><i>summon past time duplicate</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day, a phane can summon a duplicate of one its foes stolen from a parallel alternate past. The stolen <i>time duplicate</i> has the same stats and possessions as the original, but is treated as if having two negative levels (which simulates a less experienced version of the original). The phane can never summon a past <i>time duplicate</i> of a creature with more than 25 HD (add sufficient negative levels to compensate for high foe HD, if necessary). The past <i>time duplicate</i>, despite having most of the knowledge of the original, serves the phane loyally like any summoned creature. If the past <i>time duplicate</i> is slain, the original is not harmed because the duplicate was pulled from a parallel past. However, the original does not necessarily realize this, and must make a Will save (DC 30) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds after witnessing the death of a duplicate for the first time.</p><p><b>Abomination Traits:</b> Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other form-altering attacks; not subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.</p><p><b>Null Time Field (Ex):</b> Phanes continually generate a 30-foot-radius spread null time field. All creatures and objects in the field, except the phane, must make a Will saving throw (DC 30) each round to take any actions. On a failed save, subjects are stuck in a static time stream until their next round of actions, at which time they must make another saving throw. While a subject is stuck in a static time stream induced by a null time field, the phane can use its static touch on the subject, though in all other ways, the subject is invulnerable to attacks and damage as if in temporal stasis.</p><p><b>Time Regression (Su):</b> If the phane spends an action per round for four rounds, at the end of the 4th round the phane regresses back in time 4 rounds, to the very 1st round it originally began concentrating on time regression. On its second pass through the time stream, it can take completely different actions, based on its knowledge of the future (though if it takes different actions from its first pass through the time stream, the events of the original time stream are also changed).</p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Phanes take normal damage from holy and good weapons, and from weapons forged in the future or an alternate reality's time stream (if any).</p><p/></new-text></monster>

The creature heals 20 points of damage (or 40 on a rend or critical hit) whenever it drains Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. The attack allows a Fortitude save (DC 58).

  <new-text><p><h2>Demilich</h2></p><p>Demiliches speak the languages they knew as liches and as living creatures.</p><p>A demilich's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Trap the Soul (Su):</b> A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fortitude saving throw (DC 36). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich's form. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either <i>resurrection</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>,  <i>clone</i>,  or <i>miracle</i>. A potential victim protected by a <i>death ward</i> spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw and is effective against the level loss on a successful save. The DC is Charisma-based</p><p><b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or be affected as though by <i>fear</i> as cast by a 21st-level caster. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</b> Any living creature a demilich touches must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 36) or be permanently paralyzed. <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim. The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a demilich seems dead, though a successful Spot check (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the victim is still alive.</p><p><b>Spells:</b> The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich. This sample demilich was a 21st-level wizard (spells per day: 4/12/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/6/3). The last three spell slots are 10th-level slots and available for 0-9th level metamagic spells.</p><p><b>Perfect Automatic Still Spell (Ex):</b> A demilich can cast all the spells it knows without gestures.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>alter self</i>,  <i>astral projection</i>,  <i>create greater undead</i>,  <i>create undead</i>,  <i>death knell</i>,  <i>enervation</i>,  <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  <i>harm</i> (usually used to heal itself ), <i>summon monster I-IX</i>,  <i>telekinesis</i>,  <i>weird</i>; 2/day-<i>greater planar ally</i>. Demiliches use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their spellcaster level, but the save DCs are all 36. The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Magic Immunity (Ex):</b> Demiliches are immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. A <i>shatter</i> spell affects a demilich as if it were a crystalline creature, but deals half the damage normally indicated. A <i>dispel evil</i> spell deals 3d6 points of damage (Fort save for half damage). <i>Holy smite</i> spells affect demiliches normally.</p><p><b>Phylactery Transference (Su):</b> Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and other wearable items kept in close association with the demilich's phylactery transfer all their benefits to the demilich no matter how far apart the demilich and the phylactery are located. The standard limits on types of items utilized simultaneously still apply. The sample demilich 'wears' <i>bracers of armor +8</i>,  <i>headband of intellect +6</i>,  <i>pink Ioun stone</i>,  <i>ring of wizardry</i> I, <i>ring of protection +2</i>,  and <i>gloves of Dexterity +2</i>. </p><p><b>Undead Traits:</b> Immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive dam-age, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.</p><p><b>Immunities (Ex):</b> Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks.</p><p/><p><h3>Creating A Demilich</h3></p><p>'Demilich' is a tem-plate that can be added to any lich. It uses all the lich's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. A demilich's form is concentrated into a single portion of its original body, usually its skull. Part of the process of becoming a demilich includes the incorporation of costly gems into the retained body part; see Creating Soul Gems, below.</p><p>Size: Medium-size and Large liches become Diminutive demiliches, Huge liches become Small demiliches, Gargantuan liches become Medium-size demiliches, and Colossal liches become Large demiliches.</p><p><b>Hit Dice:</b> As lich.</p><p><b>Speed:</b> Replace with fly 180 ft. (perfect) or the lich's supernatural (not natural) fly speed, whichever is better.</p><p><b>AC:</b> The demilich retains the lich's +5 natural armor bonus and gains an insight bonus equal to AC equal to its Hit Dice, as well as a probable size adjustment to AC.</p><p><b>Attack:</b> The demilich gains an insight bonus equal to its Hit Dice as a bonus on its touch attacks.</p><p><b>Damage:</b> The demilich gains an enhanced touch attack over that of its previous lich form (it now uses its entire flying skull to make the touch attack), including paralyzing touch. The demilich's touch attack uses negative energy to deal 10d6+20 points of damage to living creatures (no saving throw). Liches with other natural attacks lose them.</p><p><b>Special Attacks:</b> The demilich retains all the lich's special attacks and also gains those described below.</p><p><b><i>Trap the Soul (Su):</i></b> A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fort saving throw (DC 10 + demilich's HD + demilich's Cha modifier). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems incorporated into the demilich's form. The gem gleams wickedly for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at the end of that time the soul is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either <i>resurrection</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>,  <i>clone</i>,  or <i>miracle</i>. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either <i>resurrection</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>,  <i>clone</i>,  or <i>miracle</i>. A potential victim protected by a <i>death ward</i> spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw and is effective against the level loss on a successful save.</p><p><b><i>Fear Aura (Su):</i> </b>Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 14 + demilich's Cha modifier) or be affected as though by <i>fear</i> as cast by a 21st-level caster.</p><p><b><i>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</i> </b>Any living creature a demilich touches must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + demilich's HD + demilich's Cha modifier) or be permanently paralyzed. <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim. The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a demilich seems dead, though a successful Spot check (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the victim is still alive.</p><p>Spells: The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich.</p><p><i>Perfect Automatic Still Spell:</i> The demilich can cast all the spells it knows without gestures.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>alter self</i>,  <i>astral projection</i>,  <i>create greater undead</i>,  <i>create undead</i>,  <i>death knell</i>,  <i>enervation</i>,  <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  <i>harm</i> (usually used to heal itself ), <i>summon monster I-IX</i>,  <i>telekinesis</i>,  and <i>weird</i>; 2/day- <i>greater planar ally</i>. Demiliches use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their spellcaster level, but the save DCs are equal to 10 + the demilich's HD + the demilich's Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Special Qualities:</b> The demilich retains all the lich's special qualities and also has those described below.</p><p><b><i>Magic Immunity (Ex):</i></b> Demiliches are immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. A <i>shatter</i> spell affects a demilich as if it were a crystalline creature, but deals half the damage normally indicated. A <i>dispel evil</i> spell deals 3d6 points of damage (Fort save for half damage). <i>Holy smite</i> spells affect demiliches normally.</p><p><b><i>Phylactery Transference (Su):</i></b> Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and other wearable items kept in close association with the demilich's phylactery transfer all their benefits to the demilich no matter how far apart the demilich and the phylactery are located. The standard limits on types of items utilized simultaneously still apply.</p><p><b><i>Undead Traits:</i></b> Immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.</p><p><b><i>Immunities (Ex):</i></b> Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks.</p><p><b><i>Turn Resistance (Ex):</i> </b>A demilich has turn resistance +20.</p><p><b><i>Damage Reduction (Su):</i></b> A demilich loses any previous damage reduction and instead has damage reduction 15/Epic and bludgeoning (15  points of damage is subtracted from all melee attacks unless the weapon used is both an epic and a bludgeoning weapon). Vorpal weapons, no matter their enhancement bonus, ignore this damage reduction but do only half damage to a demilich (demiliches cannot be beheaded).</p><p><b><i>Resistances (Ex):</i></b> Demiliches have acid resistance 20, fire resistance 20, and sonic resistance 20.</p><p><b>Saves:</b> Same as the lich.</p><p><b>Abilities:</b> A demilich gains +10 to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Demiliches receive a +20 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the lich (this overlaps with the previous racial bonus gained by the lich; it does not stack).</p><p><b>Feats:</b> Same as the lich.</p><p><b>Epic Feats:</b> Demiliches gain the feats Blinding Speed, Tenacious Magic, and Automatic Quicken Spell.</p><p><b>Environment:</b> Same as the lich.</p><p><b>Organization:</b> Solitary or consistory (1 demilich and 3-6 liches).</p><p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as the lich + 6.</p><p><b>Treasure:</b> Same as the lich.</p><p><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil.</p><p><b>Advancement:</b> By character class.</p><p/><p><h3>Demilich Characters</h3></p><p>The process of becoming a demilich can be undertaken only by a lich acting of its own free will. The demilich retains all class abilities it had as a lich.</p><p/><p><h3>Creating Soul Gems</h3></p><p>Liches have phylacteries that allow them to reappear 1d10 days after their apparent death, as do demiliches. Demiliches also have eight soul gems, each of which acts like a phylactery in its own right. If all the soul gems, as well as the demilich's phylactery, are not destroyed after a demilich is downed, the demilich reappears 1d10 days after its apparent death. The soul gems also allow the demilich to use its most devastating ability, trap the soul (see above). Each demilich must make its own soul gems, which requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The lich must be a sorcerer, wizard, or cleric of at least 21st level. Each soul gem costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation. Soul gems appear as egg-shaped gems of wondrous quality. They are always incorporated directly into the concentrated form of the demilich.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Genius Loci</h2></p><p>A genius loci is difficult to spot, since it looks like any other section of landscape. A genius loci itself has no intelligence, but rather 'emulates' the sentience of any creature it currently enslaves (see below), if any.  Each genius loci has only a single enslaved creature at one time, though other creatures may also inhabit the surface of the genius loci. Any creature entering a genius loci who makes a successful Survival check (DC 31) realizes that something is amiss, though it is difficult to tell exactly what. Genius loci do not speak directly, though they may do so through their currently enslaved thrall.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A genius loci can directly attack any creature standing on its surface with animated parts of itself, delivering slam attacks. It also directs its enslaved thrall against those it attacks. If its slave is slain, it selects another of its foes as its next, newest slave. Once a genius loci animates a portion of itself to attack the boundaries of its form become clear, and the creature becomes open to attack (Survival checks to determine the extent of the genius loci are no longer necessary). The animated part of the genius loci has a reach of 15 feet.</p><p><b>Enslave (Su):</b> A genius loci can use the epic spell <i>enslave</i> once per round as a free action until it successfully enslaves a foe (Will DC 53 to resist). The DC is Charisma-based. Once it has a slave, it cannot enslave another until its current slave dies, is <i>imprisoned</i>, or is otherwise incapaticiated. A slave becomes free if its genius loci master is slain. A genius loci forces its slave to remain with it, though it may send its slave off to temporarily visit nearby locations in order to draw in unsuspecting victims. In fact, the 'purposes' of the genius loci are to some degree influenced by the current slave. The genius loci has no Intelligence score of its own; thus, its emulation of its slave's intelligence sometimes transfers attitudes and goals. However, a slave can only go so far in influencing its mobile master, and cannot knowingly attempt to free itself from the genius loci that keeps it close.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If the genius loci hits a Gargantuan or smaller creature with a slam attack, it deals normal Damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. The genius loci has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals slam attack Damage, in addition to constriction Damage.</p><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A genius loci crushes its opponent, dealing 4d10+30 points of bludgeoning Damage, after making a successful grapple check.</p><p><b>Ooze Traits:</b> An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature. Oozes are immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. They have no clear front or back and are therefore not subject to critical hits or flanking. Oozes are blind but have the blindsight special quality. They have no Intelligence scores and are therefore immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p><p/></new-text></monster>

At the same time, the legions of eyes have the ability to cast a host of spells at a rapid rate.</p><p><b>Gibbering (Su):</b> The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of mouths that make up the orb forces all within 60 feet of the creature to succeed at a Will save each round (DC 40) or suffer the effects of an <i>insanity</i> spell.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the gibbering orb must hit with a bite attack. If it gets a hold, the orb automatically deals bite Damage and can attempt to swallow whole.</p><p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> A gibbering orb can attempt to swallow a Large or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 4d8 points of constriction Damage plus 3d10 points of acid Damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 20 points of Damage in a single blow (AC 16, damage reduction 10/epic still applies). Once the creature exits, the fluidlike body structure of the orb closes the wound; other swallowed opponents must cut their own way out. When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see below) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.</p><p><b>Eye Rays (Su):</b> Two dozen of the eyes can each produce a magical ray each round, with each eye emulating a spell from among the list of spells below as if cast by a 27th-level caster. The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 feet. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: <i>cone of cold</i>,  <i>disintegrate</i>,  <i>dominate monster</i>,  <i>energy drain</i>,  <i>feeblemind</i>,  <i>finger of death</i>,  <i>flesh to stone</i>,  <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  <i>harm</i>,  <i>hold monster</i>,  <i>horrid wilting</i>,  <i>implosion</i>,  <i>inflict critical wounds</i>,  <i>lightning bolt</i>,  <i>magic missile</i>,  <i>mage's disjunction</i>,  <i>irresistible dance</i>,  <i>polymorph any object</i>,  <i>power word blind</i>,  <i>power word kill</i>,  <i>power word stun</i>,  <i>prismatic spray</i>,  <i>slay living</i>,  and <i>temporal stasis</i>. </p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-Two stolen spells or spell-like abilities per round. Caster level 27th, save DC 16 + spell level.</p><p><b>All-Around Vision (Ex):</b> The gibbering orb's many eyes give it a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.</p><p><b>Flight (Ex):</b> The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy also grants it a permanent <i>feather fall</i> effect with personal range.</p><p><b>Amorphous (Ex):</b> A gibbering orb is not subject to critical hits. It has no clear front or back, so it cannot be flanked.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Hagunemnon (Protean)</h2></p><p>A hagunemnon's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Psionics (Sp):</b> At will <i>-detect thoughts</i>,  <i>dimension door</i>,  <i>ethereal jaunt</i>,  <i>knock</i>,  <i>nondetection</i>,  <i>plane shift</i>,  <i>suggestion</i>. Caster level 20th, save DC 22.</p><p><b>Destabilize Form (Su):</b> If a protean hits with two or more slam attacks in the same round, it partly destabilizes its foe's physical form, dealing an additional 4d6+31 points of Damage as well as 2 points of temporary Constitution Damage. If the victim is drained to 0 Constitution, its dead body is only so much clear fluid that drains away unless somehow preserved by friends of the victim.</p><p><b>Alter Shape (Ex):</b> A protean can assume the shape of any combination of physical nondeific creatures at the same time as a free action. In fact, a protean's form constantly boils, and it requires a move-equivalent action each round for a protean to maintain a certain shape (even if that shape is a combination of several shapes). Whatever its present form, the protean retains all its own special qualities. Plus, it gains the advantage of up to four extraordinary abilities from the forms it mimics (but not spell-like or supernatural powers). The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension (make sure to take into account rules for reach and size modifiers to AC and melee attacks). Incorporeal traits can also be assumed, which counts as a single extraordinary ability. If a hagunemnon assumes a partial form that confers an extraordinary ability already possessed by the creature, only the better of the two abilities is retained. No matter its form, the protean can never make more than five attacks using a full-round action. However, it may substitute a melee attack form for one of its slam attacks, using its own base attack bonus and Strength modifier to Damage, but dealing base Damage appropriate to the attack type.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Living Vault</h2></p><p>To access a vault, its creator must call the vault from where it is sequestered through the use of a <i>sending</i> spell. The vault has no obvious opening; however, items can be stored and retrieved by naming them (the living vault provides an inventory to its creator on request). The item to be stored appears to sink into the living vault's form as if made of mud. Likewise, items retrieved pop out of the living vault's form. Storing and retrieving items in this fashion takes one round per transaction. Creatures other than the vault's master who wish to access the inventory must destroy the vault to do so. If a vault is destroyed, all the objects and creatures stored within immediately emerge.</p><p>A living vault's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b><i>imprisonment</i> (Sp):</b> As a free action twice per day, a living vault can project a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone must make a Will save (DC 58) or be affected as by the <i>imprisonment</i> spell, except creatures are stored within the vault's interior. The living vault can hold two Gargantuan creatures, eight Huge creatures, thirty-two Large creatures, one hundred twenty-eight Medium-size creatures, and so on. This assumes that the rest of the vault is also relatively empty, so a large hoard of treasure reduces the number of creatures a living vault can hold at any one time. If <i>freedom</i> is later cast upon the very spot where the victim of <i>imprisonment</i> disappeared, the victim is freed, though it doesn't appear where it disappeared, but in a space adjacent to wherever the living vault is currently physically located.</p><p><b>Recognition (Ex):</b> Once made, a living vault responds only to its owner; no other being can access the vault's interior. The vault is not fooled by disguised creatures, and can distinguish between its true master and false duplicates, even penetrating disguises used in conjunction with <i>shapechange</i>,  <i>alter self</i>,  <i>disguise self</i>,  <i>polymorph</i>,  <i>seeming</i>,  and <i>simulacrum</i> and similar effects. The vault does, however, respond to the product of a <i>clone</i> spell.</p><p><b><i>Safekeeping</i> (Sp):</b> At will, a living vault can use a power that combines the effects of <i>sequester</i> and <i>plane shift</i> to render the vault invisible to any form of sight or divination, and at the same time transfer it to a random portion of the Astral Plane. When in safekeeping mode, the living vault responds to a <i>sending</i> by its master, returning to the location from which it left and becoming tangible once again. Creatures and objects that are stored within the vault are treated as if under the effects of <i>sequester</i>,  whether the vault itself is or not. Often, creatures are brought into the vault via <i>Imprisonment</i>,  but sometimes unconscious or otherwise subdued creatures are stored as an object, in which case they receive no saving throw to resist the effect.</p><p><b>Construct Traits:</b> Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Cannot heal Damage (though regeneration and fast healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.</p><p><b>Magic Immunity (Ex):</b> A living vault is immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. A <i>freedom</i> spell cast on it causes it to defer the use of its own <i>imprisonment</i> power for 10 rounds.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Mu Spore</h2></p><p>Mu spores speak Common and Terran.</p><p>A mu spore's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Spore Cough (Su):</b> Once every 1d4 rounds a mu spore can release a cloud of burrowing spores. This spore cough is treated as a 100-foot-cone breath weapon. The burrowing spores deal 20d8 points of Damage to all creatures and structures in the area, or half Damage to any creatures that make a Reflex save (DC 36). The DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If a mu spore hits with a tendril, it deals normal Damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Improved grab works only against Gargantuan and smaller opponents. The mu spore has the option to conduct the grapple normally, transfer the victim to its mouth as a free action, or simply use its tendril to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the Damage given for the tendril.</p><p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> If the mu spore begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth, it can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey and the opponent takes bite Damage. A swallowed creature takes the twice the Damage given for the mu spore's bite every round. A swallowed creature is considered grappled, while the creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light piercing or slashing weapon, if it can deal 33 points of Damage in this fashion, or it can just try to escape the grapple. If the swallowed creature chooses the latter course, success puts it back in the mu spore's mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.</p><p><b>Sticky (Ex):</b> Sticky tendrils cover a mu spore, many more than the four main tendrils it uses for combat. Any creature that touches or successfully attacks a mu spore with a melee weapon is subject to a free improved grab check by the mu spore, as if the mu spore had success-fully attacked the creature with a tendril. A creature wielding a melee weapon must immediately relinquish its grip on its weapon, or proceed with the grapple check. If the subject relinquishes its grip on its weapon, the weapon is swallowed the following round. Creatures who attack the mu spore in melee without a weapon they can release (such as those with natural attacks only) do not have this option.</p><p><b>Plant Traits:</b> Immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing; not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Neh-Thalggu (Brain Collector)</h2></p><p>A creature whose brain has been harvested by a brain collector cannot be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected while the brain is in the creature, because the collector preserves and draws upon the soul and basic personality of the creature for as long as it retains the brain. Neh-thalggus' own language is a silent sign language 'spoken' with their writhing head-tentacles. They can also communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language within 100 feet.</p><p>A neh-thalggu's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> A neh-thalggu's bite injects a debilitating poison (DC 32) that Damages the victim's Constitution. He or she loses half his or her current Constitution immediately on a failed save and must save again 1 minute later or lose half of his or her remaining Constitution. If the character survives, he or she heals the ability Damage at the normal rate (1 point per day). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Head-Tentacles (Ex):</b> The long, whiplike tentacles that frame either side of a brain collector's face can deliver a dangerous touch attack that, if successful, causes the target to dehydrate and wither (2d10 points of desiccation Damage). In addition, each successful tentacle attack drains 1 point of Strength, 1 point of Dexterity, and 1 point of Constitution. This is permanent ability drain and may only be reversed by spells such as <i>restoration</i> and <i>greater restoration</i>. It can bring all ten tentacles to bear on a single target facing it or divide its attacks against up to ten targets that it threatens.</p><p><b><i>Extract Brains</i> (Sp):</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, as a full-round action, a brain collector can extract the brain from a target creature in line of sight. This attack is psionic in nature and can be blocked by a <i>dimensional anchor</i> currently in force on the target. The target gets a Will save (DC 31) to resist the extraction. The save DC is Intelligence-based. If the save fails, his or her brain is drawn out intact through the skull by extradimensional means and sucked up by the brain collector, lodging in an unused storage sac above and behind its eyes. If the save succeeds, he or she takes 9d6 points of Damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A brain collector prefers to absorb brains of high-level arcane spellcasters but is fully capable of extracting those of other foes as a highly effective attack. When encountered, assume a neh-thalggu has a full retinue of thirteen stolen brains. Each brain less than the full thirteen bestows one negative level on the neh-thalggu (though these never convert to actual level loss), which is a powerful incentive for the creature to always keep its brain-sacs filled. A neh-thalggu is free to draw on all the Knowledge skills of each brain it currently stores, using the base ranks in a skill possessed by each brain, and adjusted by the neh-thalggu's own skill modifiers for the Knowledge skill in question (or its Intelligence modifier, for a skill it has no ranks in).</p><p><b><i>Dimensional Travel</i> (Sp):</b> A brain collector's preferred method of locomotion is via <i>dimension door</i>,  which it can do as a quickened action, once per round. It can also use <i>greater teleport</i> or <i>plane shift</i> at will as a move-equivalent action.</p><p><b>Spells (Sp):</b> A fully grown brain collector can cast arcane spells as a 13th-level sorcerer (one level of spell-casting ability per brain).</p><p><b>Incorporeal:</b> A neh-thalggu is not wholly in our reality but always remains partially extradimensional. Thus it can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better weapons, magic, or psionics, with a 50% chance to ignore any Damage from a corporeal source. It can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor (except for its bite attack, which is treated as if a corporeal attack). It always moves silently unless it chooses otherwise.</p><p><b>Amorphous Physiology (Ex):</b> A brain collector does not have fixed organs. As such, it is immune to critical hits, death from massive Damage, sneak attacks, and coup de grace.</p><p><b>Manifest Maw:</b> Though it is an incorporeal creature, a neh-thalggu can manifest its mouth in corporeal form as a standard action. While so manifested, the mouth can deliver bite attacks against corporeal creatures or pick up objects. The mouth bites as if it had Str 35.</p><p><b>Feats:</b> A neh-thalggu gains Power Attack as a bonus feat, even though it has no Strength score.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Prismasaurus</h2></p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Prismatic Emanations (Su):</b> The reflected and refracted light from the prismasaurus's crystalline ridge functions very similarly to the <i>prismatic spray</i> spell.

In addition, any creature within 20 feet of the prismasaurus is randomly struck by one or more rays of light, as determined by the table that accompanies the <i>prismatic spray</i> spell.

The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p><p><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> The ruin swarm notices and locates creatures within 200 ft. Opponents still have 100% concealment against the swarm (but swarm attacks ignore concealment).</p><p><b>Distraction (Ex):</b> Any living creature vulnerable to the swarm's damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 45 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even with a successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration requires a Concentration check (DC 20). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Swarm Traits:</b> A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons.</p><p>Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the swarm to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple another.</p><p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>), with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a -10 penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead.</p><p>A swarm rendered unconscious by means of subdual damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit points exceed its subdual damage.</p><p><b>Vermin Traits:</b> A ruin swarm is immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot range).</p><p/></new-text></monster>

The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 6 more Con points. The creature heals 30 points of Damage whenever it drains 6 points of Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the opponent is slain by blight-fire, only icy fragments of the victim remain, until they reform as a winterwight.  The save DC is Charisma-dased.</p><p><b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> Any humanoid slain by a shadow of the void becomes a winterwight in 1d4 rounds. Winterwights are under the command of the shadow of the void that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life, though they do possess general knowledge of the slain creature. This knowledge is used for evil purposes, if possible.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>deeper darkness</i>,  <i>freezing sphere</i>. Caster level 24th; save DC 20 + spell level. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Incorporeal Traits:</b> Can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or magic, with a 50% chance to ignore any Damage from a corporeal source. Can pass through solid objects at will, and own attacks pass through armor. Always moves silently.</p><p><b>Undead Traits:</b> Immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.</p><p><b>Cold Subtype:</b> Immunity to cold. Vulnerability to fire, (takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).</p><p><b>Cold Aura (Su):</b> A 10-foot-radius spread cold aura surrounds a shadow of the void. All creatures of the cold sub-type in the area (including the shadow of the void) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead) and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to cold Damage take 2d10 points of cold Damage each round they remain within the cold aura.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

On a failed check for the subject, the goo hardens into a partial cocoon, and the victim is treated as if grappled (even though the thorciasid is free to do as it desires). The subject can attempt to break the grapple of the cocoon (or use Escape Artist) each round, making an opposed grapple check against the cocoon (check modifier +37 for the cocoon). A thorciasid can reinforce a partial cocoon by spending a standard action secreting additional goo. Each action so spent provides an additional +5 to the cocoon's grapple check modifier. Visually, the victim becomes more and more covered and is finally com-pletely encased in a cocoon. Even fully encased victims can still breathe, and a thorciasid can drain a victim's life force at its leisure.</p><p><b>Ability Drain (Su):</b> On a successful melee touch attack with a forelimb, the thorciasid permanently drains 1d4+1 points of Strength, 1d4+1 points of Dexterity, and 1 point of Constitution from the victim. The thorciasid regains 20 lost hit points with each successful ability drain.</p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> On a successful melee touch attack with an antenna, the thorciasid gives the victim one negative level. Each negative level bestowed upon a victim gives the thorciasid +1 bonus to its Constitution that lasts for 24 hours. The negative levels similarly last for 24 hours, at which time the victim must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 34) to avoid level loss. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Umbral Blot (Blackball)</h2></p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Disintegrating Touch (Ex):</b> Any material object that comes into contact with a blackball is immediately disintegrated unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC 38). A character or object that has been disintegrated by an umbral blot disappears completely, leaving behind not even dust to mark its passing. Those who make a successful saving throw still take 5d6 points of Damage from the disintegrating touch. Likewise, weapons or objects that save take a like amount of Damage. (Remember, tended or held objects save with the same bonus as their owners.)</p><p><b>Vortex (Ex):</b> Normally a blackball insulates itself somehow from the air around it (otherwise it would perpetually be at the center of a howling wind-storm). If it chooses, instead of allowing the air to bend around it, the blackball can suspend this insulation, causing a sudden rush of wind to pour toward the blackball from all directions. This vortex sucks all the air from a 30-foot-by-30-foot-by-30-foot room in a single round, creating a sudden influx of air in its direction. All flying or floating creatures within 30 feet of the umbral blot who fail a Reflex save (DC 38) are swept along with the wind into contact with the blackball. Nonflying creatures within 30 feet who fail a Reflex save (DC 19) are pulled into contact with the umbral blot. Contact with an umbral blot could lead to disintegration, as noted above.</p><p><b>Spell Immunities (Ex):</b> In addition to the spells that an umbral blot is immune to because of its construct traits, it is immune to <i>disintegration</i> spells and variations thereof.</p><p><b>Planar Travel (Ex):</b> A blackball can fold space at will, allowing it to use <i>ethereal jaunt</i>,  <i>dimension door</i>,  <i>greater teleport</i>,  or <i>plane shift</i> at will as a standard action.</p><p><b>Construct Traits:</b> Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and to poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Cannot heal Damage (though regeneration and fast healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

As per the spell, a vermiurge may completely suppress the aura of insects as desired. A vermiurge's aura of doom constantly replenishes itself at a rate of 200 vermin per round (unlimited duration). When vermin die off either by being slain or by dealing Damage to another creature, the aura does not permanently collapse, even if all the vermin are slain or if all 1,000 vermin deal their Damage in 1 round. As soon as any vermin are replenished, they participate normally in the <i>crown of vermin</i> effect.</p><p><b>Concealing Aura (Ex):</b> Its aura of doom constantly provides a vermiurge with nine-tenths concealment, so all attacks made against it have a 40% miss chance.</p><p><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> This ability takes effect automatically when the vermiurge first engages its aura of doom. It affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the creature has. The affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 48) or become shaken. Success indicates that the target is immune to that creature's frightful presence for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Sting or bite, Fort save (DC 44); initial Damage 1d6 temporary Con, secondary Damage 2d6 temporary Con.

  <new-text><p><h2>Worm that Walks</h2></p><p>A worm that walks rarely speaks, although it retains knowledge of all languages it knew in life, as well as any it has learned since.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Spells:</b> A worm that walks can cast any spells it could cast as a character. This sample worm was a 23rd-level wizard (spells per day: 4/12/6/6/6/5/5/5/5/4/1/1). The last spell slots are 10th-level and 11th-level slots, respectively, and are available for 0-9th level meta-magic spells.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day-<i>animal growth</i> (vermin), <i>animal messenger</i> (vermin), <i>animal shapes</i> (vermin), <i>animal trance</i> (vermin), <i>colossal vermin</i> (as <i>giant vermin</i>, but it can increase the creature's size from Large to Gargantuan and from Huge to Colossal), <i>creeping doom</i>,  <i>giant vermin</i>,  <i>summon swarm</i> (vermin), <i>summon vermin</i> (as <i>summon nature's ally</i>,  except it summons 10 HD of vermin per level), and <i>vermin plague</i> (as <i>insect plague</i>). Caster level 20th; save DC 9 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Engulf (Ex):</b> A worm that walks can choose to engulf an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than itself. The worm attempts to embrace its victim, and with a successful melee touch attack, the victim is immediately swallowed up and surrounded by a mass of vermin, taking 100 points of damage. A victim who spends a full-round action can break free of the embrace and move up to half its speed away from the worm if desired, but can do nothing else. Otherwise, each round a victim remains embraced, it takes another 100 points of Damage. Constructs are immune to this attack.</p><p><b>Spells:</b> The worm that walks can cast any spells it could cast when a living character. It also gains several related abilities.</p><p><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> When a worm that walks engulfs a victim, witnesses must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the worm's HD + the worm's Cha modifier). Those who make the save are shaken. Those who fail by 5 or fewer points are frightened. Those who fail by 6 to<sup><b>10</b></sup> points are panicked. Those who fail by 11 or more points are cowering. All these conditions last for 1d4 rounds. Those who have seen a worm use this attack before gain a +5 bonus on their saving throws. The victim of the worm's engulf attack has a -5 penalty on his or her saving throw.</p><p><b>Discorporate (Ex):</b> If gravely threatened, a worm can discorporate as a free action, simply falling into a pile of individual vermin that slither quickly away. So long as any of the component vermin survive, they can breed and create a new body to house the wizard's intelligence and personality. Discorporating is a dangerous tactic, because once separated, the vermin are treated no differently than other vermin. Also, the worm stands a good chance of losing all its equipment. However, discorporation almost assures that at least one maggot (if not dozens) will manage to crawl away, and so provide for the worm's continued existence.</p><p><b>Immunities (Ex):</b> A worm that walks has no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p><p><b>Possessions:</b> Scrolls of <i>fireball</i> (10th-level caster), greater <i>teleport</i>,  <i>acid fog</i>,  <i>incendiary cloud</i>,  <i>shapechange</i>,  <i>wail of the</i> <i>banshee</i>,  <i>clenched fist</i>,  <i>horrid wilting</i>,  <i>maze</i>,  <i>summon monster IX</i>; <i>potions of cure serious wounds</i>,  <i>alter self</i>,  <i>haste</i>,  <i>fly</i>. Other magic gear: <i>amulet of natural armor +2</i>,  <i>bracers of armor +8</i>,  <i>ring of protection +3</i>,  <i>+4 staff</i>, <i>rod of absorption</i>,  <i>gloves of Dexterity +4</i>,  <i>headband of intellect +6</i>,  <i>pink Ioun stone</i>,  <i>wings of flying</i>.</p><p/><p><h3>Creating A Worm that Walks</h3></p><p>'Worm that walks' is a template that can be added to any evil wizard or sorcerer.

It also gains one special attack, engulf.</p><p><b>Engulf (Ex)</b>: A worm that walks can choose to engulf an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than itself. The worm attempts to embrace its victim, and with a successful melee touch attack, the victim is immediately swallowed up and surrounded by a mass of vermin, taking 100 points of Damage as the biting vermin nibble away. A victim who spends a full-round action can break free of the embrace and move up to half its speed away from the worm if desired, but can do nothing else. Otherwise, each round a victim remains embraced, it takes another 100 points of Damage.

Caster level 20th.</p><p><b>Special Qualities:</b> A worm that walks retains any special abilities it had in life and gains those mentioned below.</p><p><b><i>Blindsight (Ex):</i></b> Worms that walk have blindsight 300 ft.</p><p><b><i>Spell Resistance (Ex):</i></b> A worm that walks has spell resistance equal to its Challenge Rating +10.</p><p><b><i>Frightful Presence (Su):</i></b> When a worm that walks engulfs a victim, witnesses must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the worm's HD + the worm's Cha modifier). Those who make the save are shaken. Those who fail by 5 or fewer points are frightened. Those who fail by 6 to 10 points are panicked. Those who fail by 11 or more points are cowering. All these conditions last for 1d4 rounds. Those who have seen a worm use this attack before gain a +5 bonus on their saving throws.

The body is buried in an elaborate ritual that, the spellcaster hopes, will attract a critical mass of worms or maggots. The spellcaster performing the ritual must spend 10,000 gp in rare reagents for the ceremony. Furthermore, the ritual drains 2,000 XP from the spell-caster and requires the following spells: <i>limited wish</i>,  <i>polymorph any object</i>,  <i>summon swarm</i> (heightened to 7th level), and <i>sympathy</i>. Even if the ritual is performed correctly, there is only a chance that the deceased spellcaster will arise as a worm that walks. For each prepared but uncast arcane spell the deceased had at the moment of death (or unused spell slots if a spontaneous caster), there's a 1% chance that a worm that walks will slither from the grave soil in 1d4 days. Some worms that walk arise spontaneously from ordinary burial plots, but such an event is exceedingly rare. And an epic spell can create worms that walk every time without fail.</p><p/><p><h3>Gathering of Maggots</h3></p><p>When this spell is cast, worms or maggots slither and crawl their way inexorably toward the corpse touched. Over the course of the next week, they consume the flesh of the corpse, and when the last bit of the corpse is devoured, the creature is returned to a semblance of life as a worm that walks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Shark</h2></p><p>These carnivorous fish are aggressive and liable to make unprovoked attacks against anything that approaches them. Smaller sharks are from 5 to 8 feet long and not usually dangerous to creatures other than their prey. Large sharks can reach around 15 feet in length and are a serious threat. Huge sharks are true monsters, like great whites, that can exceed 20 feet in length.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Sharks circle and observe potential prey, then dart in and bite with their powerful jaws.</p><p><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> A shark can locate creatures underwater within a 30-foot radius. This ability works only when the shark is underwater.</p><p><b>Keen Scent (Ex):</b> A shark can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A shark has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Squid, Giant</h2></p><p>These voracious creatures can have bodies more than 20 feet long and attack almost anything they meet.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An opponent can attack a giant squid's tentacles with a sunder attempt as if they were weapons. A giant squid's tentacles have 10 hit points each. If a giant squid is currently grappling a target with the tentacle that is being attacked, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder attempt. Severing one of a giant squid's tentacles deals 5 points of damage to the creature. A giant squid usually withdraws from combat if it loses five tentacles. The creature regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.</p><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A giant squid deals 1d6+8 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a giant squid must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. *A giant squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.</p><p><b>Ink Cloud (Ex):</b> A giant squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 20 feet high by 20 feet wide by 20 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.</p><p><b>Jet (Ex):</b> A giant squid can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 320 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A giant squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Barghest</h2></p><p>A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblin-wolf hybrid with terrible jaws and sharp claws. As whelps, barghests are nearly indistinguishable from wolves, except for their size and claws. As they grow larger and stronger, their skin darkens to bluishred and eventually becomes blue altogether.</p><p>A full-grown barghest is about 6 feet long and weighs 180 pounds. A barghest's eyes glow orange when the creature becomes excited.</p><p>Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and usually disdain weapons. Though they love killing, they have little stomach for direct combat and attack from ambush whenever possible. Barghests start a combat by using <i>crushing despair</i> and <i>charm monster</i> to keep opponents off balance. They try to stay away from the enemy's main strength.</p><p>A barghest's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>blink</i>,  <i>levitate</i>,  <i>misdirection</i> (DC 14), <i>rage</i> (DC 15); 1/day-<i>charm monster</i> (DC 16), <i>crushing despair</i> (DC 16), <i>dimension door</i>. Caster level equals the barghest's HD.</p><p>The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Feed (Su):</b> When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a <i>wish</i>,  <i>miracle</i>,  or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.</p><p>A barghest advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a barghest devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally.</p><p>The barghest only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a greater barghest upon completion of the act.</p><p><b>Change Shape (Su):</b> A barghest can assume the shape of a goblin or a wolf as a standard action. In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In wolf form, a barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.</p><p><b>Pass Without Trace (Ex):</b> A barghest in wolf form can use pass without trace (as the spell) as a free action.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> *A barghest in wolf form gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.</p><p/><p><h3>Greater Barghest</h3></p><p>A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding becomes a greater barghest. These creatures can change shape into a goblinlike creature of Large size (about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds) or a dire wolf. In goblin form, a greater barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In dire wolf form, a greater barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.</p><p>A greater barghest can reach a maximum of 18 Hit Dice through feeding.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> In addition to the spelllike abilities all barghests possess, a greater barghest gains the following abilities. At will-<i>invisibility sphere</i>; 1/day-<i>mass bull's strength</i>, <i>mass enlarge</i>. Caster level equals the greater barghest's HD.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a magic two-handed weapon in combat instead of its claws, giving it multiple attacks (attack bonus +13/+8). It can also make one bite attack (attack bonus +8) each round. The save DC against a greater barghest's spell-like abilities is 14 + spell level.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Barghest</h2></p><p>A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblin-wolf hybrid with terrible jaws and sharp claws. As whelps, barghests are nearly indistinguishable from wolves, except for their size and claws. As they grow larger and stronger, their skin darkens to bluishred and eventually becomes blue altogether.</p><p>A full-grown barghest is about 6 feet long and weighs 180 pounds. A barghest's eyes glow orange when the creature becomes excited.</p><p>Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and usually disdain weapons. Though they love killing, they have little stomach for direct combat and attack from ambush whenever possible. Barghests start a combat by using <i>crushing despair</i> and <i>charm monster</i> to keep opponents off balance. They try to stay away from the enemy's main strength.</p><p>A barghest's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>blink</i>,  <i>levitate</i>,  <i>misdirection</i> (DC 14), <i>rage</i> (DC 15); 1/day-<i>charm monster</i> (DC 16), <i>crushing despair</i> (DC 16), <i>dimension door</i>. Caster level equals the barghest's HD.</p><p>The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Feed (Su):</b> When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a <i>wish</i>,  <i>miracle</i>,  or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.</p><p>A barghest advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a barghest devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score improvements normally.</p><p>The barghest only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a greater barghest upon completion of the act.</p><p><b>Change Shape (Su):</b> A barghest can assume the shape of a goblin or a wolf as a standard action. In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In wolf form, a barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.</p><p><b>Pass Without Trace (Ex):</b> A barghest in wolf form can use pass without trace (as the spell) as a free action.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> *A barghest in wolf form gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.</p><p/><p><h3>Greater Barghest</h3></p><p>A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding becomes a greater barghest. These creatures can change shape into a goblinlike creature of Large size (about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds) or a dire wolf. In goblin form, a greater barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In dire wolf form, a greater barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.</p><p>A greater barghest can reach a maximum of 18 Hit Dice through feeding.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> In addition to the spelllike abilities all barghests possess, a greater barghest gains the following abilities. At will-<i>invisibility sphere</i>; 1/day-<i>mass bull's strength</i>, <i>mass enlarge</i>. Caster level equals the greater barghest's HD.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a magic two-handed weapon in combat instead of its claws, giving it multiple attacks (attack bonus +13/+8). It can also make one bite attack (attack bonus +8) each round. The save DC against a greater barghest's spell-like abilities is 14 + spell level.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

A behir is about 40 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue.

A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15).

The save DC is Constitution-based. Smoke inside the victim solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at the surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. An affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous menace.</p><p><b>Smoke Form (Su):</b> Most of the time a belker is more or less solid, but at will it can assume smoke form. It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. A belker in smoke form can fly at a speed of 50 feet (perfect).

  <new-text><p><h2>Chaos Beast</h2></p><p>The horrific creatures known as chaos beasts have mutable, ever-changing forms. A chaos beast's dimensions vary, but it always weighs about 200 pounds.</p><p>Chaos beasts do not speak.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>For all its fearsome appearances, whether it has claws, fangs, pincers, tentacles, or spines, a chaos beast does little physical harm. Regardless of form, the creature seems unable to manage more than two attacks per round. Its continual transmutations prevent the coordination needed to do more.</p><p>A chaos beast's claw attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Corporeal Instability (Su):</b> A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p>An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried-armor, backpacks, even shirts-hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).</p><p>Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast.</p><p>A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful.</p><p>Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove. A <i>shapechange</i> or <i>stoneskin</i> spell does not cure an afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A <i>restoration</i>,  <i>heal</i>,  or <i>greater restoration</i> spell removes the affliction (a separate <i>restoration</i> is necessary to restore any drained points of Wisdom).</p><p><b>Immunity to Transformation (Ex):</b> No mortal magic can permanently affect or fix a chaos beast's form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

A chuul is about 8 feet long and weighs 650 pounds.</p><p>Chuuls speak Common (or Undercommon, for the underground variety).</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A chuul prefers to wait by the shore, submerged in murky water, until it hears nearby prey (in or out of the water) that it can attack with surprise. A chuul grabs with its claws and constricts its foe, then passes the opponent to its paralytic tentacles. It tries to always have one claw free, so if it faces a large number of opponents, it drops a paralyzed or dead victim and continues attempting to grab, constrict, and paralyze the rest.</p><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> On a successful grapple check, a chuul deals 3d6+5 points of damage.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a chuul must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict or on its next turn transfer a grabbed opponent to its tentacles.</p><p><b>Paralytic Tentacles (Ex):</b> A chuul can transfer grabbed victims from a claw to its ten- tacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw but deal no damage. However, they exude a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul's turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+2 points of damage each round from the creature's mandibles.</p><p><b>Amphibious (Ex):</b> Although chuuls are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A chuul has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Cloaker</h2></p><p>When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to distinguish from common black cloaks (the cloaker's ivory claws look very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does the horrific nature of the creature become apparent.</p><p>A cloaker has a wingspan of about 8 feet. It weighs about 100 pounds.</p><p>Cloakers speak Undercommon.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey. If facing a single opponent, a cloaker uses its engulf attack. Against multiple foes, it lashes with its tail in concert with its moan and shadow shift abilities to reduce the opposition's numbers, then engulfs a survivor. Multiple cloakers usually split up, leaving one or two behind to use special abilities while the rest make melee attacks.</p><p><b>Moan (Ex):</b> A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan as a standard action. By changing the frequency, the cloaker can cause one of four effects. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mindaffecting attacks. Unless otherwise specified, a creature that successfully saves against one of these effects cannot be affected by the same moan effect from the same cloaker for 24 hours. All save DCs for moan effects are Charisma-based.</p><p><i>Unnerve:</i> Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear the moan for more than 6 consecutive rounds must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or enter a trance, unable to attack or defend themselves until the moaning stops.</p><p><i>Fear:</i> Anyone within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 2 rounds.</p><p><i>Nausea:</i> Anyone in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be overcome by nausea and weakness.</p><p>Affected characters fall prone and become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds.</p><p><i>Stupor:</i> A single creature within 30 feet of the cloaker must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a <i>hold monster</i> spell for 5 rounds. Even after a successful save, the creature must repeat the save if the cloaker uses this effect again.</p><p><b>Engulf (Ex):</b> A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The cloaker attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its whiplike tail to strike at other targets.</p><p>Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.</p><p><b>Shadow Shift (Su):</b> A cloaker can manipulate shadows. This ability is effective only in shadowy areas and has three possible effects.</p><p><i>Obscure Vision:</i> The cloaker gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds.</p><p><i>Dancing Images:</i> This effect duplicates a <i>mirror image</i> spell (caster level 6th).</p><p><i>Silent Image:</i> This effect duplicates a <i>silent image</i> spell (DC 15, caster level 6th).

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b>: Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial damage 2d4 Str, secondary damage 4d4 Str.</p><p>The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Psionics (Sp):</b> At will-<i>detect chaos</i>,  <i>detect evil</i>,  <i>detect good</i>,  <i>detect law</i>,  <i>detect thoughts</i> (DC 15), <i>invisibility</i>,  <i>plane shift</i> (DC 20), <i>polymorph</i> (self only). Effective caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Spells:</b> A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.</p><p>It can choose its spells known from the sorcerer list, the cleric list, and from the lists for the Air, Good, and Law domains. The cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.</p><p><i>Typical Spells Known</i> (6/7/7/7/4; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-<i>cure minor wounds</i>,  <i>daze</i>,  <i>disrupt undead</i>,  <i>light</i>,  <i>obscuring mist</i>,  <i>ray of frost</i>,  <i>read magic</i>,  <i>resistance</i>; 1st-<i>endure elements</i>,  <i>mage armor</i>,  <i>protection from chaos</i>,  <i>true strike</i>,  <i>wind wall</i>; 2nd-<i>cure moderate wounds</i>,  <i>eagle's splendor</i>,  <i>scorching ray</i>,  <i>silence</i>; 3rd-<i>gaseous form</i>,  <i>magic circle against evil</i>,  <i>summon monster III</i>; 4th- <i>charm monster</i>,  <i>freedom of movement</i>.</p><p><b>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</b> This ability works like the <i>ethereal jaunt</i> spell (caster level 16th).</p><p><b>Telepathy (Su):</b> A couatl can communicate telepathically with any creature within 90 feet that has an Intelligence score.

  <new-text><p><h2>Darkmantle</h2></p><p>The darkmantle hangs from a ceiling by a muscular 'foot' at the top of its body. It can look like a stalactite, by holding its tentacles stiffly under itself, or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so the membrane between them covers its body. Its shell and skin usually resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can change its color to match almost any type of stony background.</p><p>A darkmantle is about 4 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the top of its head. It weighs about 30 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A darkmantle attacks by dropping onto its prey and wrapping its tentacles around the opponent's head. Once attached, it squeezes and tries to suffocate the foe. A darkmantle that misses its initial attack often flies up and tries to drop on the opponent again.</p><p><b>Darkness (Su):</b> Once per day a darkmantle can cause darkness as the <i>darkness</i> spell (caster level 5th). It most often uses this ability just before attacking.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a darkmantle must hit a Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p><p>If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent's head and can constrict.</p><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p><p><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> A darkmantle can 'see' by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain objects and creatures within 90 feet. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A darkmantle has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p><p>These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The creature's variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Delver</h2></p><p>A delver is about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. It weighs about 6,000 pounds.</p><p>Delvers speak Terran and Undercommon.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, which it uses to protect its flanks while lashing out with its flippers.</p><p>A delver expecting trouble may honeycomb an area with tunnels, leaving most closed with layers of stone 1 or 2 inches thick.</p><p>The delver can quickly dissolve the stone cover and pop up to attack unexpectedly.</p><p><b>Corrosive Slime (Ex):</b> A delver produces a mucuslike slime that contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly effective against stone. A delver's mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, a delver's slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent's armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. These save DCs are Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Stone Shape (Ex):</b> A delver can alter its slime to temporarily soften stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a delver can soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of stone, as a <i>stone shape</i> spell (caster level 15th).</p><p/></new-text></monster>

If they face stiff resistance, they may teleport away to loose a few spell-like effects at the foe.</p><p>A balor's <i>+1 flaming whip</i> is a long, flexible weapon with many tails tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls. The weapon deals bludgeoning and slashing damage, in addition to fire damage.</p><p>A balor's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Death Throes (Ex):</b>When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding flash of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 30 half ). This explosion automatically destroys any weapons the balor is holding. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Entangle (Ex):</b> A balor's <i>+1 flaming whip</i> entangles foes much like an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points. The whip needs no folding. If it hits, the target and the balor immediately make opposed Strength checks; if the balor wins, it drags the target against its flaming body (see below).

  <new-text><p><h3>Bebilith</h3></p><p>Bebiliths are enormous, predatory, arachnid demons that hunt other demons. A bebilith has a body the size of a plow horse, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs more than two tons.</p><p>Bebiliths understand but do not speak Abyssal. Their telepathy allows them to communicate silently with one another.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A bebilith attacks any creature it sees. It usually picks one target and concentrates its attacks on that opponent, using its webs to isolate the target from its comrades. Should the bebilith become overwhelmed by tougher opponents, it often attempts to bite one or more of its victims and retreats, allowing its poison to do its work.</p><p>A bebilith's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage 2d6 Con. Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing its potency and becoming inert, foul-smelling goo almost as soon as it comes into contact with air. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Rend Armor (Ex):</b> If a bebilith hits with both claw attacks, it pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.</p><p><b>Web (Ex):</b> A bebilith can throw a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 30 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet. This attack is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.</p><p>An entangled creature can escape with a DC 24 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 24 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based. The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. There is a 75% chance that the webbing will not burn if any sort of fire is applied to it (check each round).</p><p><b>Plane Shift (Su):</b> This ability affects only the bebilith. It is otherwise similar to the spell (caster level 12th).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A bebilith has mottled coloration that gives it a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

A retriever has a body the size of an ox, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs about 6,500 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Retrievers attack with four claws, but their eye rays are far more deadly.</p><p><b>Eye Rays (Su):</b> A retriever's eyes can produce four different magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray as a free action. A particular ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever can fire an eye ray in the same round that it makes physical attacks. The save DC for all rays is 18. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p><p>The four eye effects are:</p><p><i>Fire:</i> Deals 12d6 points of fire damage to the target (Reflex half ).</p><p><i>Cold:</i> Deals 12d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex half ).</p><p><i>Electricity:</i> Deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to the target (Reflex half ).</p><p><i>Petrification:</i> The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn to stone permanently.</p><p><b><i>Find Target</i> (Sp):</b> When ordered to find an item or a creature, a retriever does so unerringly, as though guided by <i>discern location</i>.</p><p>The being giving the order must have seen (or must have an item belonging to) the creature to be found, or must have touched the object to be located.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its mouth.

  <new-text><p><h2>Derro</h2></p><p>Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with an overpowering urge to inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with creatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of his mind.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from hiding. They delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later, and favor traps and poisons that disable without killing.</p><p><b>Madness (Ex):</b> Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity to <i>confusion</i> and <i>insanity</i> effects. A derro cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> spell.</p><p>*The racial madness of the derro provides a +6 bonus to their Charisma scores and a -6 penalty to their Wisdom scores. A derro restored to sanity gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.</p><p><b>Poison Use (Ex):</b> Derro typically carry 2d4 doses of greenblood oil or Medium monstrous spider venom, applying it to their crossbow bolts. Derro are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling poison.</p><p><b>Sneak Attack (Ex):</b> Any time a derro's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a derro flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same limitations.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>darkness</i>,  <i>ghost sound</i>; 1/day- <i>daze</i> (DC 13),  <i>sound burst</i> (DC 15). Caster level 3rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex):</b> A derro takes 1 point of Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points are recovered at the rate of 1 per every 24-hour period spent underground or otherwise sheltered from the sun.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Derro have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Destrachan</h2></p><p>The dungeon-dwelling destrachan looks like some bizarre, nonintelligent beast, but it's an incredibly evil and crafty sadist. A destrachan has a pair of complex, three-part ears that it can adjust to be more or less sensitive to various sounds. It is blind, yet hunts with a sense of hearing more precise than most creatures' sight.</p><p>From its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a stone wall. So skilled is a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can choose what type of material to affect with its attack.</p><p>A destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of the tail and weighs about 4,000 pounds.</p><p>A destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If a destrachan must communicate, it does so through action.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with surprise if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.</p><p><b>Destructive Harmonics (Su):</b> A destrachan can blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect any creatures or objects within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the harmonics of this destructive power to affect different types of targets. All save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><i>Flesh:</i> Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this attack deals 4d6 points of damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).</p><p><i>Nerves:</i> A destrachan can focus its harmonics to knock out foes rather than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).</p><p><i>Material:</i> When using this form of harmonics, a destrachan chooses wood, stone, metal, or glass. All objects made of that material within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or shatter. Objects (or portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit points are potentially affected by this attack.</p><p><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> A destrachan can use hearing to ascertain all foes within 100 feet as a sighted creature would.</p><p><b>Immunities:</b> Destrachans have immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.</p><p><b>Protection from Sonics (Ex):</b> While they can be affected by loud noises and sonic spells (such as <i>ghost sound</i> or <i>silence</i>), destrachans are less vulnerable to sonic attacks (+4 circumstance bonus on all saves) because they can protect their ears. A destrachan whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, and all targets are treated as having total concealment.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A destrachan has a +10 racial bonus on Listen checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h3>Chain Devil (Kyton)</h3></p><p>Kytons are humanlike devils, wrapped in chains instead of clothing. A chain devil is 6 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds, chains included.</p><p>Chain devils speak Infernal and Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A chain devil attacks by flailing away with the spiked chains that serve as its clothing, armor, and weapons.</p><p>A chain devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Dancing Chains (Su):</b> A chain devil's most awesome attack is its ability to control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, a chain devil can increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as effectively as the devil itself. If a chain is in another creature's possession, the creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the chain devil's power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the creature's possession. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p>A chain devil can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making Climb checks.</p><p><b>Unnerving Gaze (Su):</b> Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A chain devil can make its face resemble one of an opponent's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Chain devils take normal damage from silvered weapons, good-aligned weapons, and spells or effects with the good descriptor. A chain devil that loses a piece of its body regrows it in 2d6x10 minutes. Holding the severed member against the stump enables it to reattach instantly.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Chain devils have a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks involving metalwork.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

They rarely retreat, even against overwhelming odds. They love to fight with their spiked chains, usually singling out the most powerful foes to stun and eliminate quickly.</p><p>A horned devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>dispel chaos</i> (DC 21), <i>dispel good</i> (DC 21), <i>magic circle against good</i>,  <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only); <i>persistent image</i> (DC 21) 3/day-<i>fireball</i> (DC 19), <i>lightning bolt</i> (DC 19). Caster level 15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> A horned devil can radiate a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. A creature in the area must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell (caster level 15th). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same horned devil's aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Stun (Su):</b> Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. This ability is a function of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain.</p><p><b>Infernal Wound (Su):</b> The damage a horned devil deals with its tail attack causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 additional hit points each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 24 Heal check, a <i>cure</i> spell, or a <i>heal</i> spell. However, a character attempting to cast a <i>cure</i> spell or a <i>heal</i> spell on a creature damaged by a horned devil's tail must succeed on a DC 24 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful Heal check automatically stops the continuing hit point loss as well as restoring hit points. The check DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b><i>summon devil</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day a horned devil can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d6 bearded devils with a 50% chance of success, 1d6 barbed devils with a 35% chance of success, or another horned devil with a 20% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.</p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> A horned devil takes normal damage from good-aligned silvered weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Devourer</h2></p><p>Devourers lurk on the Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane, stalking both natives and travelers with equal sadistic glee.</p><p>A devourer is about 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.</p><p>Devourers speak Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Even if it had no special abilities, a devourer would be a terrible opponent, for its bony claws can flay enemies alive.</p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> Living creatures hit by a devourer's claw attack or <i>spectral hand</i> ability gain one negative level. The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Trap Essence (Su)</b>: The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy's life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based. A slain creature's essence is trapped within the devourer's ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim's features. The trapped essence cannot be raised or resurrected, but a <i>limited wish</i>,  <i>miracle</i>,  or <i>wish</i> spell frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one essence at a time.</p><p>The trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one negative level for every five times the devourer uses one of its spell-like abilities. When the essence's number of negative levels equals the creature's total Hit Dice or level, the essence is destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose that level permanently.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities</b>: At the start of any encounter, the trapped essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels (enough fuel for thirty to seventy-five uses). Once per round, a devourer can use one of the following abilities: <i>confusion</i> (DC 17), <i>control undead</i> (DC 20), <i>ghoul touch</i> (DC 15), <i>lesser planar ally</i>,  <i>ray of enfeeblement</i> (DC 14), <i>spectral hand</i>,  <i>suggestion</i> (DC 16), <i>true seeing</i>. Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Spell Deflection (Su):</b> The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence instead: <i>banishment</i>,  <i>chaos hammer</i>,  <i>confusion</i>,  <i>crushing despair</i>,  <i>detect thoughts</i>,  <i>dispel evil</i>,  <i>dominate person</i>,  <i>fear</i>,  <i>geas/quest</i>,  <i>holy word</i>,  <i>hypnosis</i>,  <i>imprisonment</i>,  <i>magic jar</i>,  <i>maze</i>,  <i>suggestion</i>,  <i>trap the soul</i>,  or any form of charm or compulsion. In many cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its spell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

Its tail extends straight out behind itself, held aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. It weighs about 600 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A deinonychus uses a combination of speed, grasping forearms, large teeth, and hind legs with ripping talons. It hunts by running at prey, leaping, and ripping with its rear talons as it claws and bites. The talons count as one attack. A deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics.</p><p><b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a deinonychus charges, it can make a full attack.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A deinonychus has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen, Spot, and Survival checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h3>Doppelganger</h3></p><p>Doppelgangers are strange beings that are able to take on the shapes of those they encounter. In its natural form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A doppelganger's appearance is deceiving even when it's in its true form. A doppelganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping with its frail appearance.</p><p>Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived.</p><p>It is natural form a doppelganger is about 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>When in its natural form, a doppelganger strikes with its powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its detect thoughts ability to employ the same tactics and strategies as the person it is impersonating.</p><p><b>Detect Thoughts (Su):</b> A doppelganger can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 13 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Change Shape (Su):</b> A doppelganger can assume the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid. In humanoid form, the doppelganger loses its natural attacks. A doppelganger can remain in its humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a doppelganger reverts to its natural form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell or ability reveals its natural form.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A doppelganger has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.</p><p>*When using its change shape ability, a doppelganger gets an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If it can read an opponent's mind, it gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.</p><p><h4>Doppelgangers as Characters</h4></p><p>Doppelganger characters possess the following racial traits.</p><p>-A doppelganger's base land speed is 30 feet.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.</p><p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.</p><p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems-especially sapphires.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.</p><p><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning.</p><p><b><i>Create/Destroy Water</i> (Sp):</b> A blue dragon of any age can use this ability three times per day. It works like the <i>create water</i> spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) or be ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.</p><p><b>Sound Imitation (Ex):</b> A juvenile or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) to detect the ruse.</p><p><b>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>ventriloquism</i> (adult or older); 1/day-<i>hallucinatory terrain</i> (old or older), <i>veil</i> (ancient or older), <i>mirage arcana</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Bluff, Hide, and Spellcraft are considered class skills for blue dragons.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.</p><p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.</p><p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems-especially sapphires.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.</p><p><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning.</p><p><b><i>Create/Destroy Water</i> (Sp):</b> A blue dragon of any age can use this ability three times per day. It works like the <i>create water</i> spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) or be ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.</p><p><b>Sound Imitation (Ex):</b> A juvenile or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon's frightful presence) to detect the ruse.</p><p><b>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>ventriloquism</i> (adult or older); 1/day-<i>hallucinatory terrain</i> (old or older), <i>veil</i> (ancient or older), <i>mirage arcana</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Bluff, Hide, and Spellcraft are considered class skills for blue dragons.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Bronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use <i>detect thoughts</i> to learn intelligent creatures' intentions.</p><p>When attacking they blind their opponents with <i>fog cloud</i> and then charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels' hulls. If a dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed, fogbound, or broken-masted.</p><p><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning and a cone of <i>repulsion</i> gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Bronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use <i>detect thoughts</i> to learn intelligent creatures' intentions.</p><p>When attacking they blind their opponents with <i>fog cloud</i> and then charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels' hulls. If a dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed, fogbound, or broken-masted.</p><p><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning and a cone of <i>repulsion</i> gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment effect.</p><p><b>Water Breathing (Ex):</b> A bronze dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</p><p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A young or older bronze dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>speak with animals</i>; 3/day-<i>create food and water</i> (adult or older), <i>fog cloud</i> (adult or older), <i>detect thoughts</i> (old or older), <i>control water</i> (ancient or older); 1/day-<i>control weather</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Disguise, Swim, and Survival are considered class skills for bronze dragons.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

Gold dragons' faces are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ <i>bless</i> and their <i>luck bonus</i>; older dragons use their <i>Luck Bonus</i> at the start of each day. They make heavy use of spells in combat.

Creatures within a cone of weakening gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category of the dragon.</p><p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.</p><p><b>Water Breathing (Ex):</b> A gold dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged (the cone of fire becomes a cone of superheated steam underwater).</p><p><b><i>Luck Bonus</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10-foot radius per age category of the dragon receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and similar rolls, as for a <i>stone of good luck</i>. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon but ends if the gem is destroyed. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p><p><b><i>Detect Gems</i> (Sp):</b> An old or older gold dragon can use this ability three times per day. This is a divination effect similar to a <i>detect magic</i> spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a 60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.</p><p><b>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>bless</i> (juvenile or older); 1/day-<i>geas/quest</i> (old or older), <i>sunburst</i> (ancient or older), <i>foresight</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Disguise, Heal, and Swim are considered class skills for gold dragons.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

This is a divination effect similar to a <i>detect magic</i> spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a 60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.</p><p><b>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>bless</i> (juvenile or older); 1/day-<i>geas/quest</i> (old or older), <i>sunburst</i> (ancient or older), <i>foresight</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Disguise, Heal, and Swim are considered class skills for gold dragons.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

Creatures within a cone of weakening gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category of the dragon.</p><p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid.

As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10-foot radius per age category of the dragon receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and similar rolls, as for a <i>stone of good luck</i>. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon but ends if the gem is destroyed. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p><p><b><i>Detect Gems</i> (Sp):</b> An old or older gold dragon can use this ability three times per day. This is a divination effect similar to a <i>detect magic</i> spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a 60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.</p><p><b>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>bless</i> (juvenile or older); 1/day-<i>geas/quest</i> (old or older), <i>sunburst</i> (ancient or older), <i>foresight</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Disguise, Heal, and Swim are considered class skills for gold dragons.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

Gold dragons' faces are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ <i>bless</i> and their <i>luck bonus</i>; older dragons use their <i>Luck Bonus</i> at the start of each day. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are <i>cloudkill</i>,  <i>delayed blast fireball</i>,  <i>fire shield</i>,  <i>globe of invulnerability</i>,  <i>maze</i>,  <i>sleep</i>,  <i>slow</i>,  and <i>stinking cloud</i>.</p><p><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> A gold dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within a cone of weakening gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category of the dragon.</p><p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.</p><p><b>Water Breathing (Ex):</b> A gold dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged (the cone of fire becomes a cone of superheated steam underwater).</p><p><b><i>Luck Bonus</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10-foot radius per age category of the dragon receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and similar rolls, as for a <i>stone of good luck</i>. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon but ends if the gem is destroyed. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p><p><b><i>Detect Gems</i> (Sp):</b> An old or older gold dragon can use this ability three times per day. This is a divination effect similar to a <i>detect magic</i> spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a 60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.</p><p><b>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>bless</i> (juvenile or older); 1/day-<i>geas/quest</i> (old or older), <i>sunburst</i> (ancient or older), <i>foresight</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Disguise, Heal, and Swim are considered class skills for gold dragons.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

It weighs about 500 pounds.</p><p>Giant eagles speak Common and Auran.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving earthward at tremendous speed. When it cannot dive, it uses its powerful talons and slashing beak to strike at its target's head and eyes.</p><p>A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the vicinity of its nest and generally ignores creatures that do not appear threatening. A mated pair attacks in concert, making repeated diving attacks to drive away intruders, and fights to the death to defend their nest or hatchlings.</p><p><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> With a successful Reflex save against an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, a giant eagle takes no damage.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Giant eagles have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p><p><h3>Training A Giant Eagle</h3></p><p>Although intelligent, a giant eagle requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant eagle must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant eagle requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.</p><p>Riding a giant eagle requires an exotic saddle. A giant eagle can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p><p>Giant eagle eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant eagle.</p><p>Carrying Capacity: A light load for a giant eagle is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h3>Air Elemental</h3></p><p/><p/><p>Air elementals speak Auran, though they rarely choose to do so.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Their rapid speed makes air elementals useful on vast battlefields or in extended aerial combat.</p><p><b>Air Mastery (Ex):</b> Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.</p><p><b>Whirlwind (Su):</b> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.</p><p>The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.</p><p>The elemental's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature's space.</p><p>Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the table below for details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's size (see the table). The save DC is Strength based.</p><p>Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind.</p><p>Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume.</p><p>The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.</p><p>If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.</p><p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.</p><p>An elemental in whirlwind form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h3>Earth Elemental</h3></p><p/><p/><p>When summoned to the Material Plane, an earth elemental consists of whatever types of dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was conjured from.</p><p>Earth elementals speak Terran but rarely choose to do so.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Though an earth elemental moves slowly, it is a relentless opponent. It can travel though solid ground or stone as easily as humans walk on the earth's surface. It cannot swim, however, and must either walk around a body of water or go through the ground under it. An earth elemental can move along the bottom of a body of water but prefers not to.</p><p><b>Earth Mastery (Ex):</b> An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)</p><p><b>Push (Ex):</b> An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery, above, also apply to the elemental's opposed Strength checks.</p><p><b>Earth Glide (Ex):</b> An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)</p><p>A water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that crosses its path. An elemental can easily overturn small craft (5 feet of length per Hit Die of the elemental) and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD). Even large ships (20 feet long per HD) can be slowed to half speed.</p><p><b>Drench (Ex):</b> The elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as <i>dispel magic</i> (caster level equals elemental's HD).</p><p><b>Vortex (Su):</b> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.</p><p>The elemental's movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature's space.</p><p>Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the vortex (see the table below for details) and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the vortex or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the vortex's effects varies with the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.</p><p>Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume.</p><p>The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.</p><p>If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.</p><p>Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.</p><p>An elemental in vortex form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it.</p><p>Skills: A water elemental has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.</p><p><b>Hive Mind (Ex):</b> All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.</p><p><h3>Worker</h3></p><p>While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can communicate just fine-although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp.</p><p>A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite.</p><p>A formian worker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b><i>cure serious wounds</i> (Sp):</b> Eight workers together can heal a creature's wounds as though using the <i>cure serious wounds</i> spell (caster level 7th).

They cannot speak otherwise.</p><p>A warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 180 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at once.

If necessary, though, they can defend themselves with claws and a poison sting.</p><p>A formian taskmaster's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Dominate Monster (Su):</b> A taskmaster can use a <i>dominate monster</i> ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17 negates), although the subject may be of any kind and may be up to Large size. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same taskmaster's dominate monster ability for 24 hours. A single taskmaster can dominate up to four subjects at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Dominated Creature (Ex):</b> A taskmaster is never encountered alone. One dominated nonformian creature always accompanies it (choose or determine randomly any creature of CR 4).</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str.

If chaotic creatures are present, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them.</p><p>A formian myrmarch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Dex.

  <new-text><p><h2>Formian</h2></p><p/><p/><p>A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.</p><p><b>Hive Mind (Ex):</b> All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.</p><p><h3>Worker</h3></p><p>While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can communicate just fine-although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp.</p><p>A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite.</p><p>A formian worker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b><i>cure serious wounds</i> (Sp):</b> Eight workers together can heal a creature's wounds as though using the <i>cure serious wounds</i> spell (caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all eight workers.</p><p><b><i>make whole</i> (Sp):</b> Three workers together can repair an object as though using the <i>make whole</i> spell (caster level 7th). This is a fullround action for all three workers.</p><p><h3>Warrior</h3></p><p>Warriors communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and make reports to their commanders. They cannot speak otherwise.</p><p>A warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 180 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at once. Through the hive mind, they attack with coordinated and extremely efficient tactics.</p><p>A formian warrior's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><h3>Taskmaster</h3></p><p>These formians communicate only telepathically and derive sustenance from the mental energies of those they dominate.</p><p>A taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Taskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at all possible. If necessary, though, they can defend themselves with claws and a poison sting.</p><p>A formian taskmaster's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Dominate Monster (Su):</b> A taskmaster can use a <i>dominate monster</i> ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17 negates), although the subject may be of any kind and may be up to Large size. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same taskmaster's dominate monster ability for 24 hours. A single taskmaster can dominate up to four subjects at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Dominated Creature (Ex):</b> A taskmaster is never encountered alone. One dominated nonformian creature always accompanies it (choose or determine randomly any creature of CR 4).</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><h3>Myrmarch</h3></p><p>Myrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those beneath them, these creatures are individuals, with goals, desires, and creative thought.</p><p>A myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its claws are capable of fine manipulation, like human hands. Each myrmarch wears a bronze helm to signify its position (the more elaborate the helm, the more prestigious the position).</p><p>Myrmarchs speak Formian and Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Myrmarchs' claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose.</p><p>Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks, coated with poison from their own stingers.</p><p>They fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such are present) and commanding them through the hive mind. If chaotic creatures are present, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them.</p><p>A formian myrmarch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>charm monster</i> (DC 17), <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>,  <i>detect chaos</i>,  <i>detect thoughts</i> (DC 15), <i>magic circle against chaos</i>, <i>greater teleport</i>; 1/day-<i>dictum</i> (DC 20), <i>order's wrath</i> (DC 17). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><h3>Queen</h3></p><p>The formian queen cannot move.

  <new-text><p><h3>Djinni</h3></p><p>The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Elemental Plane of Air.</p><p>A djinni is about 10-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.</p><p>Djinn speak Auran, Celestial, Common, and Ignan.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow.</p><p><b>Air Mastery (Ex):</b> Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a djinni.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>invisibility</i> (self only); 1/day- <i>create food and water</i>,  <i>create wine</i> (as <i>create water</i>,  but wine instead), <i>major creation</i> (created vegetable matter is permanent), <i>persistent image</i> (DC 17), <i>wind walk</i>. Once per day, a djinni can assume <i>gaseous form</i> (as the spell) for up to 1 hour. Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Whirlwind (Su):</b> A djinni can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 7 rounds. In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.</p><p>The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.</p><p>A djinni's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the djinni enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the djinni moves into or through the creature's space.</p><p>Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A creature with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racial adjustment.</p><p>Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the djinni carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The djinni can have only as many trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume.</p><p>The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be.</p><p>If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.</p><p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.</p><p>A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and does not threaten the area around it.</p><p><h5><b>Noble Djinn</b></h5></p><p>Some djinn (1% of the total population) are noble. A noble djinni can grant three <i>wishes</i> to any being (nongenies only) who captures it. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third <i>wish</i>,  are free of their servitude. Noble djinn are as strong as efreet (see below), with 10 Hit Dice.</p></new-text></monster>

The save DCs are Wisdom-based.</p><p><i>Typical Cleric Spells Prepared</i> (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-<i>cure minor wounds</i>,  <i>detect magic</i>,  <i>guidance</i>,  <i>light</i>,  <i>resistance</i>,  <i>virtue</i>; 1st-<i>bless</i>,  <i>calm animals*</i>,  <i>command</i>,  <i>divine favor</i>,  <i>obscuring mist</i>,  <i>sanctuary</i>,  <i>shield of faith</i>; 2nd-<i>aid</i>,  <i>align weapon</i>,  <i>bear's endurance</i>,  <i>hold animal*</i>,  <i>lesser restoration</i>,  <i>remove paralysis</i>,  <i>zone of truth</i>; 3rd-<i>daylight</i>,  <i>gaseous form*</i>,  <i>prayer</i>,  <i>remove curse</i>,  <i>searing light</i>,  <i>water breathing</i>; 4th-<i>death ward</i>,  <i>dismissal</i>,  <i>divine power</i>,  <i>restoration</i>,  <i>summon nature's ally IV (animal)*</i>; 5th-<i>control winds*</i>,  <i>flame strike</i>,  <i>raise dead</i>,  <i>true seeing</i>; 6th-<i>banishment</i>,  <i>blade barrier</i>,  <i>chain lightning*</i>,  <i>heal</i>; 7th-<i>animal shapes*</i>,  <i>holy word</i>,  <i>summon monster VII</i>.</p><p>*Domain spell. Domains: Air and Animal.</p><p><b>Gaze (Su):</b> In humanoid form-slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the <i>fear</i> effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Light Ray (Ex):</b> A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.</p><p><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its light rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal, and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form.</p><p>A ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any particular form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell or ability, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.</p><p><b>Protective Aura (Su):</b> Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, <i>this</i> ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>,  both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals ghaele's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a ghaele's statistics block.)</p><p><b>Tongues (Su):</b> Ghaeles can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Gibbering Mouther</h2></p><p>A gibbering mouther is a horrible creature seemingly drawn from a lunatic's nightmares. Although not evil, it thirsts after bodily fluids and seems to prefer the blood of intelligent creatures.</p><p>A gibbering mouther is about 3 feet across and 3 to 4 feet high. It weighs about 200 pounds.</p><p>Gibbering mouthers can speak Common, but seldom say anything other than gibberish.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A gibbering mouther attacks by shooting out strings of protoplasmic flesh, each ending in one or more eyes and a mouth that bites at the enemy. A mouther can send out a total of six such members in any round.</p><p><b>Gibbering (Su):</b> As soon as a mouther spots something edible, it begins a constant gibbering as a free action. All creatures (other than mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>confusion</i> spell for 1d2 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same gibbering mouther's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Spittle (Ex):</b> As a free action every round, a gibbering mouther fires a stream of spittle at one opponent within 30 feet. The mouther makes a ranged touch attack; if it hits, it deals 1d4 points of acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless creatures are immune to the blinding effect, but are still subject to the acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a gibbering mouther must hit with a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p><p><b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b> On a successful grapple check after grabbing, that mouth attaches to the opponent. It automatically deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage each round. A mouth can be ripped off (dealing 1 point of damage) with a DC 12 Strength check or severed by a successful sunder attempt (the mouth has 2 hit points).</p><p>A severed mouth continues to bite and drain blood for 1d4 rounds after such an attack. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 is killed.</p><p><b>Engulf (Ex):</b> A gibbering mouther can try to engulf a Medium or smaller opponent grabbed by three or more mouths.</p><p>The opponent must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or fall and be engulfed. In the next round, the mouther makes twelve bite attacks instead of six (each with a +4 attack bonus). An engulfed creature cannot attack the mouther from within. The previously attached mouths are now free to attack others. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p><p><b>Ground Manipulation (Su):</b> At will, as a standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in all adjacent squares to become a morass akin to quicksand. Softening earth, sand, or the like takes 1 round, while stone takes 2 rounds. Anyone other than the mouther in that area must take a move-equivalent action to avoid becoming mired (treat as being pinned).</p><p><b>Amorphous (Ex):</b> A gibbering mouther is not subject to critical hits. It cannot be flanked.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p><p>A gibbering mouther has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

Against larger foes, a girallon seeks to tear a single opponent to bits as quickly as it can.</p><p><b>Rend (Ex):</b> A girallon that hits with two or more claw attacks latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh.

  <new-text><p><h2>Gnoll</h2></p><p>Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. A gnoll is a nocturnal carnivore, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. A gnoll is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Gnolls speak Gnoll.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Gnolls like to attack when they have the advantage of numbers, using horde tactics and their physical strength to overwhelm and knock down their opponents. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader; at such times, they can maintain ranks and fight as a unit. While they do not usually prepare traps, they do use ambushes and try to attack from a flanking position. Because of its shield, a gnoll's modifier on Hide checks (untrained) is -2, which means gnolls always take special care to seek favorable conditions when laying ambushes (such as darkness, cover, or some other form of advantageous terrain).</p><p><h3>Gnolls as Characters</h3></p><p>Gnoll characters possess the following racial traits.</p><p>-A gnoll's base land speed is 30 feet.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

The concept of a fair fight is meaningless in their society. They favor ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can devise.</p><p>Goblins have a poor grasp of strategy and are cowardly by nature, tending to flee the field if a battle turns against them.

A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips.</p><p>A clay golem golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise. It walks and moves with a slow, clumsy gait. It weighs around 600 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Berserk (Ex):</b> When a clay golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. Once a clay golem goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control.</p><p><b>Cursed Wound (Ex):</b> The damage a clay golem deals doesn't heal naturally and resists healing spells. A character attempting to cast a conjuration (healing) spell on a creature damaged by a clay golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character.</p><p><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> A clay golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.

The golem gets no saving throw against any of these effects.</p><p>Any magical attack against a clay golem that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a clay golem hit by the breath weapon of a black dragon heals 7 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 22 points of damage. A clay golem golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage.</p><p><b>Haste (Su):</b> After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a clay golem can haste itself once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.</p><p><h5>Construction</h5></p><p>A clay golem's body must be sculpted from a single block of clay weighing at least 1,000 pounds, treated with rare oils and powders worth 1,500 gp.

No natural animal willingly tracks a flesh golem. The golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions and no weapons. It stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 500 pounds.</p><p>A flesh golem golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Berserk (Ex):</b> When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%.</p><p><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance.

An iron golem can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below), although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait.

Whether accepted or not, the render always attempts to remain fairly close, watching over its adopted charge(s) and daily bringing an offering of meat. It never willingly harms adopted creatures and retreats if they attack it.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A gray render attacks to kill, whether to bring down prey or to protect itself or those it has adopted. When hunting, it sometimes attempts to hide and wait for prey to wander close.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a gray render must hit with its bite attack.

  <new-text><p><h2>Homunculus</h2></p><p>A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a wizard. These creatures are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts. A homunculus's creator determines its precise features. Homunculi are little more than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic nature. A homunculus cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator.</p><p>It knows what its master knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, out to a distance of 1,500 feet. A homunculus never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to regain contact with its master. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master.</p><p>If the creature's master is slain, the homunculus also dies, and its body swiftly melts away into a pool of ichor.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Homunculi land on their victims and bite with their venomous fangs.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage sleep for 1 minute, secondary damage sleep for another 5d6 minutes.

The materials cost 50 gp. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. Creating the body requires a DC 12 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 12 Craft (pottery) check.</p><p>After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and ritual can be performed together.</p><p>A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create.</p><p>Craft Construct, <i>arcane eye</i>,  <i>mirror image</i>,  <i>mending</i>,  caster must be at least 4th level; Price - (never sold); Cost 1,050 gp + 78 XP.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Howler</h2></p><p>Howlers live on planes where chaos and evil hold sway. A howler is about 8 feet long and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Although they are surprisingly intelligent, howlers do not speak-they only howl. If there is a language within the howls, as some have suggested, even spells cannot decipher it. Howlers understand Abyssal.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Howlers attack in groups, for they are cowardly and cruel. They prefer to charge into combat, race out, and then charge in again. A howler's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Quills (Ex):</b> A howler's neck bristles with long quills. While biting, the creature thrashes about, striking with 1d4 of them. An opponent hit by a howler's quill attack must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or have the quill break off in his or her flesh. Lodged quills impose a -1 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks per quill. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p><p>A quill can be removed safely with a DC 20 Heal check; otherwise, removing a quill deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.</p><p><b>Howl (Ex):</b> All beings other than outsiders that hear the creature's howling for an hour or longer are subject to its effect, though it does not help the howler in combat. Anyone within hearing range of a howler for a full hour must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or take 1 point of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. The save must be repeated for each hour of exposure. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.</p><p><h3>Training A Howler</h3></p><p>Although intelligent, a howler requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a howler must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly howler requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a howler requires an exotic saddle. A howler can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p><p><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a howler is up to 460 pounds; a medium load, 461-920 pounds; and a heavy load, 921-1,380 pounds.

An opponent can strike at a hydra's heads from any position in which he could strike at the hydra itself, because the hydra's head writhe and whip about in combat. An opponent can ready an action to attempt to sunder a hydra's head when the creature bites at him. Each of a hydra's heads has hit points equal to the creature's full normal hit point total, divided by its original number of heads. Losing a head deals damage to the body equal to half the head's full normal hit points. A natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss. A hydra can no longer attack with a severed head but takes no other penalties.</p><p>Each time a head is severed, two new heads spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A hydra can never have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number wither and die within a day. To prevent a severed head from growing back into two heads, at least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before the new heads appear. A flaming weapon (or similar effect) deals its energy damage to the stump in the same blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid damage from an area effect may burn multiple stumps in addition to dealing damage to the hydra's body. A hydra does not die from losing its heads until all its heads have been cut off and the stumps seared by fire or acid.</p><p>A hydra's body can be slain just like any other creature's, but hydras possess fast healing (see below) and are difficult to defeat in this fashion. Any attack that is not (or cannot be) an attempt to sunder a head affects the body.</p><p>Targeted magical effects cannot sever a hydra's heads (and thus must be directed at the body) unless they deal slashing damage and could be used to make sunder attempts.</p><p><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> Each round, a hydra heals damage equal to 10 + the number of its original heads.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Hydras have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks, thanks to their multiple heads.</p><p>A hydra has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.

An opponent can ready an action to attempt to sunder a hydra's head when the creature bites at him. Each of a hydra's heads has hit points equal to the creature's full normal hit point total, divided by its original number of heads. Losing a head deals damage to the body equal to half the head's full normal hit points. A natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss. A hydra can no longer attack with a severed head but takes no other penalties.</p><p>Each time a head is severed, two new heads spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A hydra can never have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number wither and die within a day. To prevent a severed head from growing back into two heads, at least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before the new heads appear. A flaming weapon (or similar effect) deals its energy damage to the stump in the same blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid damage from an area effect may burn multiple stumps in addition to dealing damage to the hydra's body. A hydra does not die from losing its heads until all its heads have been cut off and the stumps seared by fire or acid.</p><p>A hydra's body can be slain just like any other creature's, but hydras possess fast healing (see below) and are difficult to defeat in this fashion.

  <new-text><p><h3>Marut</h3></p><p>Maruts confront those who would try to deny the grave itself.</p><p>Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span could be targeted by a marut. Those who take extraordinary measures to cheat death in some other way might be labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to reverse death aren't worthy of a marut's attention unless they do so repeatedly or on a massive scale.</p><p>When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and implacably toward the foe, never resting.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Once it has found its target, a marut brings it the death it has been trying to avoid. Those who defile death through necromancy may instead receive a <i>geas</i> and/or <i>mark of justice</i> to enforce proper respect. It typically uses <i>wall of force</i> to shut off any escape routes, then opens up with <i>chain lightning</i> while it closes to melee range. Once there, it strikes with its massive fists, using <i>circle of death</i> if beset by numbers of defenders. It hits spellcasting opponents with repeated uses of <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  and it uses <i>dimension door</i> and <i>locate creature</i> to track down foes who flee.</p><p>A marut's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Fists of Thunder and Lightning (Su):</b> A marut's left fist delivers a loud thunderclap whenever it hits something, dealing an extra 3d6 points of sonic damage and causing the target to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the deafness). Its right fist delivers a shock for an extra 3d6 points of electricity damage, and the flash of lightning causes the target to be blinded for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the blindness). The save DCs are Strength-based and include the marut's Ability Focus feat.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>air walk</i>,  <i>dimension door</i>,  <i>fear</i> (DC 18),  <i>greater command</i> (DC 19),  <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  <i>mass inflict light wounds</i> (DC 19), <i>locate creature</i>,  <i>true seeing</i>; 1/day-<i>chain lightning</i> (DC 20),  <i>circle of death</i> (DC 20),  <i>mark of justice</i>,  <i>wall of force</i>; 1/week- <i>earthquake</i> (DC 22),  <i>geas/quest</i>,  <i>plane shift</i> (DC 21).

  <new-text><p><h2>Invisible Stalker</h2></p><p>Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon them to perform specific tasks.</p><p>A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.</p><p>Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A <i>see invisibility</i> spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud, while a <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals a roiling cloud of vapor.</p><p>These creatures speak only Auran but can understand Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An invisible stalker attacks by using the air itself as a weapon. It creates a sudden, intense blast of wind that pounds a single target on the same plane as the creature.</p><p>An invisible stalker can be killed only when it is on the Elemental Plane of Air. When performing a task elsewhere, it automatically returns to its home plane when it takes damage sufficient to destroy it.</p><p><b>Natural Invisibility (Su):</b> This ability is constant, allowing a stalker to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell.</p><p><b>Improved Tracking (Ex):</b> An invisible stalker is a consummate tracker and makes Spot checks instead of the usual Survival checks to trace a creature's passage.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Aboleth</h2></p><p>The aboleth is a revolting fishlike amphibian found primarily in subterranean lakes and rivers. An aboleth has a pink belly. Four pulsating blueblack orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. It uses its tail for propulsion in the water and drags itself along with its tentacles on land. An aboleth weighs about 6,500 pounds.</p><p>Aboleths speak their own language, as well as Undercommon and Aquan.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An aboleth attacks by flailing with its long, slimy tentacles, though it prefers to fight from a distance using its illusion powers.</p><p><b>Enslave (Su):</b> Three times per day, an aboleth can attempt to enslave any one living creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 16th). An enslaved creature obeys the aboleth's telepathic commands until freed by <i>remove curse</i>,  and can attempt a new Will save every 24 hours to break free.

Effective caster level 16th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Slime (Ex):</b> A blow from an aboleth's tentacle can cause a terrible affliction. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or begin to transform over the next 1d4+1 minutes, the skin gradually becoming a clear, slimy membrane. An afflicted creature must remain moistened with cool, fresh water or take 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. The slime reduces the creature's natural armor bonus by 1 (but never to less than 0). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p>A <i>remove disease</i> spell cast before the transformation is complete will restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward, however, only a <i>heal</i> or <i>mass heal</i> spell can reverse the affliction.</p><p><b>Mucus Cloud (Ex):</b> An aboleth underwater surrounds itself with a viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature coming into contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or lose the ability to breathe air for the next 3 hours. An affected creature suffocates in 2d6 minutes if removed from the water. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another Fortitude save continues the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An aboleth has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.

  <new-text><p><h2>Ankheg</h2></p><p>The ankheg is a burrowing monster with a taste for fresh meat. An ankheg has six legs, and some specimens are yellow rather than brown. It is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.</p><p>An ankheg burrows with legs and mandibles. A burrowing ankheg usually does not make a usable tunnel, but can construct a tunnel; it burrows at half speed when it does so. It often digs a winding tunnel up to 40 feet below the surface in the rich soil of forests or farmlands. The tunnel is 5 feet tall and wide, and from 60 to 150 feet long ( [1d10 + 5] x10).</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An ankheg usually lies 5 to 10 feet below the surface until its antennae detect the approach of prey. It then burrows up to attack. (Treat this as a charge, even though the ankheg does not need to move 10 feet before attacking.)</p><p>Clusters of ankhegs share the same territory but do not cooperate.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an ankheg must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the ankheg is damaged after grabbing its prey, it retreats backward down its tunnel at its land speed (not its burrow speed), dragging the victim with it.</p><p><b>Spit Acid (Ex):</b> 30-ft. line, once every 6 hours; damage 4d4 acid, Reflex DC 14 half. One such attack depletes the ankheg's acid supply for 6 hours. It cannot spit acid or deal acid damage during this time. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p>An ankheg does not use this ability unless it is desperate or frustrated. It most often spits acid when reduced to fewer than half its full normal hit points or when it has not successfully grabbed an opponent.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Aranea</h2></p><p>An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous powers. In its natural form, an aranea resembles a big spider, with a humpbacked body a little bigger than a human torso. It has fanged mandibles like a normal spider. Two small arms, each about 2 feet long, lie below the mandibles. Each arm has a hand with four many-jointed fingers and a double-jointed thumb.</p><p>An aranea weighs about 150 pounds. The hump on its back houses its brain.</p><p>Araneas speak Common and Sylvan.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An aranea avoids physical combat and uses its webs and spells when it can. In a battle, it tries to immobilize or distract the most aggressive opponents first. Araneas often subdue opponents for ransom.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Spells:</b> An aranea casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer. It prefers illusions and enchantments and avoids fire spells.</p><p><i>Typical Sorcerer Spells Known</i> (6/6; save DC 12 + spell level): 0- <i>daze</i>,  <i>detect magic</i>,  <i>ghost sound</i>,  <i>light</i>,  <i>resistance</i>; 1st-<i>mage armor</i>,  <i>silent image</i>,  <i>sleep</i>.</p><p><b>Web (Ex):</b> In spider or hybrid form (see below), an aranea can throw a web up to six times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Large size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.</p><p>An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.</p><p><b>Change Shape (Su):</b> An aranea's natural form is that of a Medium monstrous spider. It can assume two other forms. The first is a unique Small or Medium humanoid; an aranea in its humanoid form always assumes the same appearance and traits, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, an aranea cannot use its bite attack, webs, or poison.</p><p>The second form is a Medium spider-humanoid hybrid. In hybrid form, an aranea looks like a Medium humanoid at first glance, but a DC 18 Spot check reveals the creature's fangs and spinnerets. The aranea retains its bite attack, webs, and poison in this form, and can also wield weapons or wear armor. When in hybrid form, an aranea's speed is 30 feet (6 squares).</p><p>An aranea remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does an aranea revert to its natural form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell, however, reveals its natural form if it is in humanoid or hybrid form.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Araneas have a +2 racial bonus on Jump, Listen, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks even if rushed or threatened.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Arrowhawk</h2></p><p>An arrowhawk is a predator and scavenger from the Elemental Plane of Air.  By twisting its body and varying the cadence of its wingbeats, an arrowhawk can fly at top speed in any direction. A juvenile arrowhawk (1 to 10 years old) is about 5 feet long from beak to tail, with the body accounting for about one-third of that length. Its wingspan is about 7 feet, and it weighs about 20 pounds. An adult (11 to 40 years old) is about 10 feet long from beak to tail, with a wingspan of about 15 feet and a weight of about 100 pounds. An elder arrowhawk (41 to 75 years old) is about 20 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and a weight of about 800 pounds.</p><p>Arrowhawks speak Auran, but they are not usually talkative creatures.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Arrowhawks are extremely territorial and always hungry. They attack almost any other creature they meet, seeking a meal or trying to drive away a rival. The primary mode of attack is an electricity ray, fired from the tail. The creature also bites, but it prefers to stay out of reach.</p><p><b>Electricity Ray (Su):</b> An arrowhawk can fire this ray once per round, with a range of 50 feet.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Assassin Vine</h2></p><p>The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots.</p><p>A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.</p><p>An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity.</p><p>A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An assassin vine uses simple tactics:</p><p>It lies still until prey comes within reach, then attacks. It uses its entangle ability both to catch prey and to deter counterattacks.</p><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> An assassin vine deals 1d6+7 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p><p><b>Entangle (Su):</b> An assassin vine can animate plants within 30 feet of itself as a free action (Ref DC 13 partial).</p><p>The effect lasts until the vine dies or decides to end it (also a free action). The save DC is Wisdom-based. The ability is otherwise similar to <i>entangle</i> (caster level 4th).</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, an assassin vine must hit with its slam attack.</p><p>It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p><p>If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p><p><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Assassin vines have no visual organs but can ascertain all foes within 30 feet using sound, scent, and vibration.</p><p><b>Camouflage (Ex):</b> Since an assassin vine looks like a normal plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Spot check to notice it before it attacks.</p><p>Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Spot to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the subterranean version.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Kraken</h2></p><p>Six of the beast's tentacles are shorter arms about 30 feet long; the remaining two are nearly 60 feet long and covered with barbs. Its beaklike mouth is located where the tentacles meet the lower portion of its body.</p><p>Krakens speak Common and Aquan.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Krakens strike their opponents with their barbed tentacles, then grab and crush with their arms or drag victims into their huge jaws. An opponent can make sunder attempts against a kraken's tentacles or arms as if they were weapons. A kraken's tentacles have 20 hit points, and its arms have 10 hit points. If a kraken is currently grappling a target with one tentacle or arm, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity against the sunder attempt. Severing a kraken's tentacle or arm deals damage to the kraken equal to half the limb's full normal hit points. A kraken usually withdraws from combat if it loses both tentacles or three of its arms. A kraken regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the kraken must hit with an arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle damage with a successful grapple check.</p><p><b>Jet (Ex):</b> A kraken can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 280 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</p><p><b>Ink Cloud (Ex):</b> A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken normally uses to escape a fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day-<i>control weather</i>,  <i>control winds</i>,  <i>dominate animal</i> (DC 18), <i>resist energy</i>. Caster level 9th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A kraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Leonal</h2></p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Leonals like their battles as straightforward as can be. They begin with a roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with a frenzy of claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride, watching one another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks.</p><p>A leonal's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Roar (Su):</b> A leonal can roar up to three times per day. Each roar releases a blast in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a <i>holy word</i> spell and deals an extra 2d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 20 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a leonal charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a leonal must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Caster level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Lay on Hands (Su):</b> As the paladin class feature, except that each day, a leonal can heal an amount of damage equal to its full normal hit points.</p><p><b>Protective Aura (Su):</b> Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the leonal. Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>,  both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals leonal's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a leonal's statistics block.)</p><p><b>Speak with Animals (Su):</b> This ability works like <i>speak with animals</i> (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require sound.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Leonals have a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Mimic</h2></p><p>A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not more than 10 feet long. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p><p>Mimics speak Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out with a heavy pseudopod. The creature does not necessarily fight to the death if it can succeed in extorting treasure or food from a party.</p><p><b>Adhesive (Ex):</b> A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first.</p><p>A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A successful DC 16 Strength check is needed to pry it off.</p><p>Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.</p><p><b>Crush (Ex):</b> A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p><p><b>Mimic Shape (Ex):</b> A mimic can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by the mimic's Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A mimic has a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use <i>etherealness</i> until it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can benefit from the <i>heartstone</i>'s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any disease cured or saving throw affected counts as a use) and it does not bestow <i>etherealness</i> to a bearer that is not a night hag. If sold, an intact <i>heartstone</i> brings 1,800 gp.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

It weighs about 55,000 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A nightcrawler attacks by burrowing through the ground and emerging to strike.</p><p>A nightcrawler's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> Living creatures inside a nightcrawler's gizzard gain one negative level each round. The DC is 26 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p>For each such negative level bestowed, the nightcrawler gains 5 temporary hit points.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a nightcrawler must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>contagion</i> (DC 18), <i>deeper darkness</i>,  <i>detect magic</i>,  <i>greater dispel magic</i>,  <i>haste</i>,  <i>invisibility</i>,  <i>see invisibility</i>,  <i>unholy blight</i> (DC 18); 3/day-<i>cone of cold</i> (DC 19), <i>confusion</i> (DC 18), <i>hold monster</i> (DC 19); 1/day-<i>finger of death</i> (DC 21), <i>mass hold monster</i> (DC 23), <i>plane shift</i> (DC 21). Caster level 25th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Summon Undead (Su):</b> A nightcrawler can summon undead creatures once per night: 9-16 shadows, 3-6 greater shadows, or 2-4 dread wraiths. The undead arrive in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.</p><p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> A nightcrawler can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 12 points of acid damage per round from the nightcrawler's gizzard and is subject to the creature's energy drain. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A nightcrawler's interior can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, 512 Tiny or smaller opponents.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Nymph</h2></p><p>A nymph is about the height and weight of a female elf.</p><p>Nymphs speak Sylvan and Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Blinding Beauty (Su):</b> This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the <i>blindness</i> spell. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.</p><p>The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day-<i>dimension door</i>. Caster level 7th.</p><p><b>Spells:</b> A nymph casts divine spells as a 7th-level druid.</p><p><i>Typical Druid Spells Prepared</i> (6/5/4/3/1, save DC 13 + spell level): 0-<i>cure minor wounds</i>,  <i>detect magic</i>,  <i>flare</i>,  <i>guidance</i>,  <i>light</i>,  <i>resistance</i>; 1st-<i>calm animal</i>,  <i>cure light wounds</i>,  <i>entangle</i>,  <i>longstrider</i>,  <i>speak with animals</i>; 2nd-<i>barkskin</i>,  <i>heat metal</i>,  <i>lesser restoration</i>,  <i>tree shape</i>; 3rd- <i>call lightning</i>,  <i>cure moderate wounds</i>,  <i>protection from energy</i>; 4th-<i>rusting grasp</i>.</p><p><b>Stunning Glance (Su):</b> As a standard action, a wrathful nymph can stun a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target creature must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Unearthly Grace (Su):</b> A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class. (The statistics block already reflects these bonuses).</p><p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> This power works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except that a nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. She can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run action while swimming, provided she swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h3>Gelatinous Cube</h3></p><p>The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the cube's body.</p><p>A typical gelatinous cube is 15 feet on a side and weighs about 50,000 pounds, though much larger specimens are not unknown.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes.</p><p><b>Acid (Ex):</b> A gelatinous cube's acid does not harm metal or stone.</p><p><b>Engulf (Ex):</b> Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube's paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p><p><b>Paralysis (Ex):</b> A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing slime. A target hit by a cube's melee or engulf attack must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Transparent (Ex):</b> Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a cube and walk into it are automatically engulfed.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Pegasus</h2></p><p>The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily tamed.</p><p>A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi cannot speak, but they understand Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>detect good</i> and <i>detect evil</i> within a 60-foot radius. Caster level 5th.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Pegasi have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p><p><h3>Training A Pegasus</h3></p><p>Although intelligent, a pegasus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a pegasus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly pegasus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p><p>Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.</p><p><b>Carrying Capacity:</b> A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Roper</h2></p><p>A roper stands some 9 feet tall and tapers from 3 or 4 feet in diameter at the base to 1 foot across at the top. It weighs 2,200 pounds. A roper's coloration and temperature change to match the features of the surrounding cave.</p><p>Ropers speak Terran and Undercommon.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of rock. This tactic often allows it to attack with surprise. When prey comes within reach, it lashes out with its strands. In melee, it bites adjacent opponents with its powerful maw.</p><p><b>Drag (Ex):</b> If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand latches onto the opponent's body. This deals no damage but drags the stuck opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which requires a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check. The check DCs are Strength-based, and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus. A roper can draw in a creature within 10 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round. A strand has 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a roper's strand does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the strand is currently attached to a target, the roper takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a strand deals no damage to a roper.</p><p><b>Strands (Ex):</b> Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at once, and they can strike up to 50 feet away (no range increment). If a strand is severed, the roper can extrude a new one on its next turn as a free action.</p><p><b>Weakness (Ex):</b> A roper's strands can sap an opponent's strength. Anyone grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> *Ropers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in stony or icy areas.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Sahuagin</h2></p><p>Most sahuagin feature green coloration, darker along the back and lighter on the belly. Many have dark stripes, bands, or spots, but these tend to fade with age. An adult male sahuagin stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p><p>Sahuagin are the natural enemy of aquatic elves. The two cannot coexist peacefully: Wars between them are prolonged, bloody affairs that sometimes interfere with shipping and maritime trade. Sahuagin have an only slightly less vehement hatred for tritons.</p><p>Sahuagin speak their own language, Sahuagin. Thanks to their high Intelligence scores, most sahuagin also speak two bonus languages, usually Common and Aquan.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Sahuagin are savage fighters, asking for and giving no quarter. When swimming, a sahuagin tears with its feet as it strikes with its talons or a weapon. About half of any group of sahuagin are also armed with nets.</p><p><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> A sahuagin can locate creatures underwater within a 30-foot radius. This ability works only when the sahuagin is underwater.</p><p><b>Blood Frenzy:</b> Once per day a sahuagin that takes damage in combat can fly into a frenzy in the following round, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength, and takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. A sahuagin cannot end its frenzy voluntarily.</p><p><b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +2 melee, damage 1d4+1. A sahuagin also gains two rake attacks when it attacks while swimming.</p><p><b>Freshwater Sensitivity (Ex):</b> A sahuagin fully immersed in fresh water must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Even on a success, it must repeat the save attempt every 10 minutes it remains immersed.</p><p><b>Light Blindness (Ex):</b> Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a <i>daylight</i> spell) blinds sahuagin for round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled while operating in bright light.</p><p><b>Speak with Sharks (Ex):</b> Sahuagin can communicate telepathically with sharks up to 150 feet away. The communication is limited to fairly simple concepts such as 'food,' 'danger,' and 'enemy.' Sahuagin can use the Handle Animal skill to befriend and train sharks.</p><p><b>Water Dependent (Ex):</b> Sahuagin can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules on page 304 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A sahuagin has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p>*Underwater, a sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks.</p><p>*A sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Survival and Profession (hunter) checks within 50 miles of its home.</p><p>*A sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks when working with sharks.</p><p><h3>Sahuagin Mutants</h3></p><p>About one in two hundred sahuagin has four arms. Such creatures can make four claw attacks or use extra weapons, in addition to the claw and bite attacks.</p><p>If a community of aquatic elves is located within 100 miles of a sahuagin community, about one in one hundred sahuagin looks just like an aquatic elf. These creatures, called malenti, have a swim speed of 40 feet, can remain out of water for 1 hour per point of Constitution, and have freshwater sensitivity and light sensitivity (dazzled in bright light). Malenti have no natural attacks. They are otherwise identical with sahuagin.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

A satyr is about as tall and heavy as a half-elf.</p><p>Satyrs speak Sylvan, and most also speak Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>The keen senses of a satyr make it almost impossible to surprise one in the wild. Conversely, with their own natural grace and agility, satyrs can sneak up on travelers who are not carefully watching the surrounding wilderness. Once engaged in battle, an unarmed satyr attacks with a powerful head butt. A satyr expecting trouble is likely to be armed with a bow and a dagger and typically looses arrows from hiding, weakening an enemy before closing.</p><p><b>Pipes (Su):</b> Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on their pan pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries pipes. When it plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected by <i>Charm person</i>,  <i>sleep</i>,  or <i>fear</i> (caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).</p><p>In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe's effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Satyrs have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.</p><p><h3>Satyrs as Characters</h3></p><p>Satyr characters possess the following racial traits.</p><p>-A satyr's base land speed is 40 feet.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

They have been known to seize and carry off items enspelled with <i>daylight</i> spells.</p><p><b>Bay (Su):</b> When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures except evil outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same mastiff's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Trip (Ex):</b> A shadow mastiff that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action (+3 check modifier) without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the shadow mastiff.</p><p><b>Shadow Blend (Su):</b> In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow mastiff can disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment. Artificial illumination, even a <i>light</i> or <i>continual flame</i> spell, does not negate this ability.

  <new-text><p><h2>Shield Guardian</h2></p><p>Created by spellcasters to be bodyguards, shield guardians are constructs that protect their masters with spells and stamina. When it is fashioned, a shield guardian is keyed to a particular magical amulet. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet to be its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so).</p><p>A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat and possibly simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.</p><p>A shield guardian is some 9 feet tall and weighs more than 1,200 pounds.</p><p>Shield guardians cannot speak, but they understand commands given in any language.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Shield guardians are straightforward in battle, bashing with their heavy stone fists. They are made for defense and are not particularly impressive on offense.</p><p><b>Find Master (Su):</b> As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can find the amulet wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).</p><p><b>Guard (Ex):</b> If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves swiftly to defend the wearer of its amulet, blocking blows and disrupting foes. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.</p><p><b><i>Shield Other</i> (Sp):</b> The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses).</p><p><b><i>Spell Storing</i> (Sp):</b> A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It 'casts' this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).</p><p><h3>Construction</h3></p><p>A shield guardian is built from wood, bronze, stone, and steel. The materials cost 5,000 gp.</p><p>The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. Creating the body requires a DC 16 Craft (blacksmithing) or Craft (carpentry) check. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time, and its cost (20,000 gp) is included in the cost of the guardian. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. A shield guardian with more than 15 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +5,000 gp to the market price, and the price increases by +20,000 gp if the creature's size increases to Huge, modifying the cost to create accordingly.</p><p>CL 15th; Craft Construct, <i>limited wish</i>,  <i>discern location</i>,  <i>shield</i>,  <i>shield other</i>,  caster must be at least 15th level; Price 120,000 gp; Cost 65,000 gp + 4,600 XP.</p><p><h3>Amulet</h3></p><p>If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

A shocker lizard is about 1 foot tall at the shoulder and weighs about 25 pounds.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat. A lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all home in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer their shocks to the foe.</p><p><b>Stunning Shock (Su):</b> Once per round, a shocker lizard can deliver an electrical shock to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 2d8 points of nonlethal damage to living opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Lethal Shock (Su):</b> Whenever two or more shocker lizards are within 20 feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal shock. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing lizard. The shock deals 2d8 points of electricity damage for each lizard contributing to it, to a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC 10 + number of lizards contributing) reduces the damage by half.</p><p><b>Electricity Sense (Ex):</b> Shocker lizards automatically detect any electrical discharges within 100 feet.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Shocker lizards have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks due to their coloration. Shocker lizards have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p><p>Shocker lizards use their Dexterity modifier instead of their Strength modifier for Climb and Jump checks.</p><p>A shocker lizard has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.</p><p>A shocker lizard has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.

  <new-text><p><h3>Androsphinx</h3></p><p>These sphinxes are always male. Androsphinxes are clever and generally good-natured, but they can be savage opponents.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>In battle, an androsphinx rips apart enemies with its razor-sharp claws. It relies on its natural weapons in a fight, employing its spells for defense or healing.</p><p><b>Rake (Ex):</b> Attack bonus +18 melee, damage 2d4+3.</p><p><b>Roar (Su):</b> Three times per day an androsphinx can loose a mighty roar. The first time it does this, all creatures within 500 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell for 2d6 rounds.</p><p>If the sphinx roars a second time during the same encounter, all creatures within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, and all those within 90 feet are deafened for 2d6 rounds (no save). If it roars a third time during the same encounter, all those within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage for 2d4 rounds. In addition, any Medium or smaller creature within 90 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be thrown to the ground and take 2d8 points of damage. The force of this roar is so great that it deals 50 points of damage to any stone or crystalline object within 90 feet. Magic items and held or carried items can avoid damage with a DC 19 Reflex save. Other androsphinxes are immune to these effects. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Spells:</b> An androsphinx casts divine spells as a 6th-level cleric from the cleric spell list and from the Good, Healing, and Protection domains.</p><p><i>Typical Cleric Spells Prepared</i> (5/5/5/4; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-<i>cure minor wounds</i>,  <i>detect magic</i>,  <i>guidance</i>,  <i>light</i>,  <i>resistance</i>; 1st-<i>divine favor</i>,  <i>protection from evil*</i>,  <i>shield of faith</i>,  <i>remove fear</i>,  <i>summon monster I</i>; 2nd-<i>bull's strength</i>,  <i>remove paralysis</i>,  <i>resist energy</i>,  <i>shield other*</i>,  <i>summon monster II</i>; 3rd-<i>cure serious wounds*</i>,  <i>daylight</i>,  <i>invisibility purge</i>,  <i>searing light</i>.</p><p>*Domain spell.

  <new-text><p><h3>Hellwasp Swarm</h3></p><p>A single hellwasp resembles a thumb-sized normal wasp, except its carapace is gleaming black with ruby-red stripes, and its compound eyes are an iridescent green. In swarms, hellwasps form a collective hive mind intelligence with infernal cunning and bloodlust.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Like any swarm, a hellwasp swarm seeks to surround and attack any living prey it encounters. A swarm deals 3d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move. The swarm can take over the bodies of its prey and infest both the living and the dead, using them as horrible living (or unliving) puppets to accomplish acts of wickedness that a swarm of insects could never attempt.</p><p>A hellwasp swarm's attack is treated as an evil-aligned weapon and a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Distraction (Ex):</b> Any living creature that begins its turn with a hellwasp swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Inhabit (Ex):</b> A hellwasp swarm can enter the body of a helpless or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large (although four swarms working together can  inhabit a Huge creature). The swarm can abandon the body at any time, although doing this takes 1 full round. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's resistances and immunities may negate some or all of this damage.</p><p>If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can restore animation to the creature and control its movements, effectively transforming it into a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the swarm remains inside. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using <i>dominate monster</i> on the victim. The hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour they inhabit a body. A body reduced to Constitution 0 is dead.</p><p>A hellwasp-inhabited creature is relatively easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of insects inside. The swarm is intelligent enough to attempt to hide beneath loose clothing or a large cloak to keep its presence from being detected. The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host.</p><p>A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Hive Mind (Ex):</b> Any hellwasp swarm with at least 1 hit point per Hit Die (or 12 hit points, for a standard hellwasp swarm) forms a hive mind, giving it an Intelligence of 6. When a hellwasp swarm is reduced below this hit point threshold, it becomes mindless.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Tarrasque</h2></p><p>The tarrasque is 70 feet long and 50 feet tall, and it weighs about 130 tons.</p><p>The tarrasque cannot speak.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>The tarrasque attacks with its claws, teeth, horns, and tail.</p><p>The tarrasque's natural weapons are treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Augmented Critical (Ex):</b> The tarrasque's bite threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 18-20, dealing triple damage on a successful critical hit.</p><p><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> The tarrasque can inspire terror by charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition as long as they remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the tarrasque must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.</p><p><b>Rush (Ex):</b> Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet.</p><p><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> The tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the tarrasque's digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque's digestive tract (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures.</p><p><b>Carapace (Ex):</b> The tarrasque's armorlike carapace is exceptionally tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even <i>magic missile</i> spells. There is a 30% chance of reflecting any such effect back at the caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before rolling to overcome the creature's spell resistance.</p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> No form of attack deals lethal damage to the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hp). The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem's cursed wound ability.</p><p>The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hit points) and using a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell to keep it dead.</p><p>If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

It attempts to swallow as much flesh as it can, as quickly as it can.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a tendriculos must hit a creature at least one size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round. A tendriculos can also use its improved grab ability on a tendril attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up the opponent, and transfers it to the mouth as a free action, automatically dealing bite damage.</p><p><b>Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex):</b> A tendriculos can try to swallow a grabbed opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside the plant's mass, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos's digestive juices, taking 2d6 points of acid damage per round. A new save is required each round inside the plant. The save DC is Constitution-based. A swallowed creature that avoids paralysis can climb out of the mass with a successful grapple check. This returns it to the plant's maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. A swallowed creature can also cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the tendriculos's interior (AC 14). Once the creature exits, the plant's regenerative capacity closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge tendriculos's interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents.</p><p><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal normal damage to a tendriculos. A tendriculos that loses part of its body mass can regrow it in 1d6 minutes. Holding the severed portion against the mass enables it to reattach instantly.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Treant</h2></p><p>A treant's leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant's legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree.</p><p>A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a 'trunk' about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p><p>Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Sylvan. Most also can manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues-at least enough to say 'Get away from my trees!'</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as reinforcements.</p><p><b><i>Animate Trees</i> (Sp):</b> A treant can animate trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar to <i>liveoak</i> (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.</p><p><b>Double Damage against Objects (Ex):</b> A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.</p><p><b>Trample (Ex):</b> Reflex DC 22 half.

They normally conceal themselves, launch a volley of javelins, then close to attack. If the battle goes against them, they retreat and attempt to hide.</p><p>Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a troglodyte must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte's stench for 24 hours. A <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.</p><p>Skills: The skin of a troglodyte changes color somewhat, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings like a chameleon and providing a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. *In rocky or underground settings, this bonus improves to +8.</p><p><h3>Troglodyte Characters</h3></p><p>Troglodyte characters possess the following racial traits.</p><p>-A troglodyte's base land speed is 30 feet.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h3>Vampire Spawn</h3></p><p>Vampire spawn are undead creatures that come into being when vampires slay mortals. Like their creators, spawn remain bound to their coffins and to the soil of their graves. Vampire spawn appear much as they did in life, although their features are often hardened, with a predatory look.</p><p>Vampire spawn speak Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Vampire spawn use their inhuman strength when engaging mortals, hammering their foes with powerful blows and dashing them against rocks or walls. They also use their gaseous form and flight abilities to strike where opponents are most vulnerable.</p><p><b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b> A vampire spawn can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round. On each such successful drain attack, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit pints.</p><p><b>Domination (Su):</b> A vampire spawn can crush an opponent's will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must take a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell from a 5thlevel caster. The ability has a range of 30 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> Living creatures hit by a vampire spawn's slam attack gain one negative level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such negative level bestowed, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit points.</p><p><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> A vampire spawn heals 2 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.</p><p><b>Gaseous Form (Su):</b> As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will as the spell (caster level 6th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p><p><b>Spider Climb (Ex):</b> A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Vampire spawn have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.</p><p><h4>Vampire Spawn Weaknesses</h4></p><p>Vampire spawn are vulnerable to all attacks and effects that repel or slay vampires. For details, see the Vampire entry.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Vargouille</h2></p><p>A vargouille is slightly larger than a human head, about 18 inches high, with a wingspan of 4 feet. It weighs about 10 pounds.</p><p>Vargouilles speak Infernal.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Vargouilles attack by biting with their jagged teeth. Their special attacks make them even more dangerous. A vargouille's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><b>Shriek (Su):</b> Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth and let out a terrible shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with fear for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A paralyzed creature is susceptible to the vargouille's kiss (see below). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille's shriek for 24 hours. The shriek is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p><p><b>Kiss (Su):</b> A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a successful melee touch attack. An affected opponent must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that turns the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation).</p><p>First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim's hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and even a <i>daylight</i> spell can delay death, but to reverse the transformation requires <i>remove disease</i>. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 12 or be unable to heal the vargouille's bite damage naturally or magically. A <i>neutralize poison</i> or <i>heal</i> spell removes the effect, while <i>delay poison</i> allows magical healing. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

It weighs 300 pounds.</p><p>More intelligent than their smaller cousins, worgs speak their own language. Some can also speak Common and Goblin.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Mated pairs or packs work together to bring down large game, while lone worgs usually chase down creatures smaller than themselves. Both often use hit-and-run tactics to exhaust their quarry. A pack usually circles a larger opponent: Each wolf attacks in turn, biting and retreating, until the creature is exhausted, at which point the pack moves in for the kill. If they get impatient or heavily outnumber the opponent, worgs attempt to pin it.</p><p><b>Trip (Ex):</b> A worg that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the worg.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> A worg has a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks. *A worg has a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Xill</h2></p><p>A xill stands 4 to 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. Xills speak Infernal.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Xills are dangerous opponents, attacking with all four limbs. More civilized ones use weapons, usually fighting with two at a time so as to leave two claws free for grab attacks. Xills typically lie in wait on the Ethereal Plane for suitable prey to happen by, then ambush it using their planewalk ability. They make full use of their Tumble skill in combat: Usually, one or two distract physically powerful enemies by attacking, then assuming a defensive stance while their fellows maneuver to advantage.</p><p><b>Implant (Ex):</b> As a standard action, a xill can lay eggs inside a paralyzed creature. The young emerge about 90 days later, literally devouring the host from inside. A <i>remove disease</i> spell rids a victim of the egg, as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a xill must hit with one or more claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. It receives a +2 bonus on the grapple check for each claw that hits. If it wins the grapple check and maintains the hold in the next round, it automatically bites the foe at that time. The bite deals no damage but injects a paralyzing venom.</p><p><b>Paralysis (Ex):</b> Those bitten by a xill must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Planewalk (Su):</b> These planar travelers like to slip between the folds of space to attack enemies as though from thin air. They can cross from the Ethereal Plane with a move action but take 2 rounds to cross back, during which time they are immobile. As a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: Opponents have a 20% miss chance in the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can planewalk with a willing or helpless creature.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Aboleth, Psionic</h2></p><p>The aboleth is a revolting fishlike amphibian found primarily in subterranean lakes and rivers. An aboleth has a pink belly. Four pulsating blueblack orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. It uses its tail for propulsion in the water and drags itself along with its tentacles on land. An aboleth weighs about 6,500 pounds.</p><p>Aboleths speak their own language, as well as Undercommon and Aquan.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>An aboleth attacks by flailing with its long, slimy tentacles, though it prefers to fight from a distance using its illusion powers.</p><p>A psionic aboleth does not possess spell-like abilities or the enslave ability of the standard aboleth. Instead, it has psi-like abilities, including <i>psionic dominate</i>.</p><p><b>Psi-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>disable</i> (30-ft. cone, 12 HD, DC 20*), <i>false sensory input</i> (five targets, DC 16*), <i>mental disruption</i> (20-ft. radius, DC 18*), <i>mindlink</i> (unwilling, nine targets, DC 14*); 3/day-<i>ego whip</i> (ML 7th, 2d4, DC 17*), <i>id insinuation</i> (ML 7th, three targets, DC 17*), <i>psionic dominate</i> (any target, 24 hours, DC 20*), <i>thought shield</i> (power resistance 21, 3 rounds*); 1/day-<i>psionic modify memory</i> (DC 17), <i>remote viewing</i> (DC 17), <i>wall of ectoplasm</i> (DC 17). Manifester level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p>*Includes augmentation for the aboleth's manifester level.</p><p><b>Slime (Ex):</b> A blow from an aboleth's tentacle can cause a terrible affliction. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or begin to transform over the next 1d4+1 minutes, the skin gradually becoming a clear, slimy membrane. An afflicted creature must remain moistened with cool, fresh water or take 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. The slime reduces the creature's natural armor bonus by 1 (but never to less than 0). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p>A <i>remove disease</i> spell cast before the transformation is complete will restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward, however, only a <i>heal</i> or <i>mass heal</i> spell can reverse the affliction.</p><p><b>Mucus Cloud (Ex):</b> An aboleth underwater surrounds itself with a viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature coming into contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or lose the ability to breathe air for the next 3 hours. An affected creature suffocates in 2d6 minutes if removed from the water. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another Fortitude save continues the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An aboleth has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Caller in Darkness</h2></p><p>A caller in darkness is an incorporeal creature composed of the minds of dozens of victims who died together in terror. It seeks to draw others into its fearwracked, hellish existence.</p><p>Callers in darkness rarely speak, but when they do, they speak Common.</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Psi-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>clairvoyant sense</i>,  <i>concussion blast</i> (two targets, 3d6*),  <i>detect psionics</i>,  <i>ego whip</i> (2d4, DC 16*), <i>mind thrust</i> (7d10, DC 16*); 3/day-<i>death urge</i> (DC 16), <i>psychic crush</i> (DC 13**), <i>psionic suggestion</i> (three targets, DC 14*); 1/day-<i>co-opt concentration</i> (DC 18). Manifester level 7th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p>*Includes augmentation for the caller's manifester level.</p><p>**Includes the inherent +4 save adjustment described in the power.</p><p><b>Steal Essence (Su):</b> Any living, intelligent creature slain by a caller in darkness's touch attack is mentally absorbed into the monster's consciousness. (The physical body of the victim remains intact). Stealing a victim's essence is a free action; it grants the caller 12 temporary hit points, and a permanent new screaming face appears within its cloud.</p><p>A caller in darkness can also steal the essence of living, intelligent creatures within 30 feet that are paralyzed or sleeping, or that are helpless due to having a mental ability score reduced to 0 (often by the caller's <i>ego whip</i> attack). Doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The victim dies, and the caller gains 12 temporary hit points.</p><p><b>Incorporeal Traits:</b> A caller in darkness is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. The creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.</p><p><b>Undead Traits:</b> A caller in darkness is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, <i>sleep</i>,  paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and <i>resurrection</i> works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60 feet.</p><p><b>Unnatural Aura (Su):</b> Animals can sense the unnatural presence of a caller in darkness. Any animal within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or become panicked until it is no longer within 30 feet of the caller in darkness. A panicked creature that is cornered begins cowering. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex):</b> Callers in darkness are utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell) and flee from it. A caller caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but  not both (nor can it take full-round actions).</p><p/></new-text></monster>

It weighs about 1,800 pounds.</p><p>Couatls speak Celestial, Common, and Draconic, and also have the power of telepathy (see below).</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>A couatl uses its <i>detect thoughts</i> ability on any creature that arouses its suspicions. Since it is highly intelligent, a couatl usually casts spells from a distance before closing. If more than one couatl is involved, they discuss their strategy before a battle.</p><p>The psionic couatl does not possess the psionic spell-like abilities of the standard couatl. Instead, it has psi-like abilities.</p><p><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A couatl deals 2d8+6 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p><p><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a couatl must hit a creature of up to two size categories larger with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p><p><b>Psi-Like Abilities:</b> At will-<i>aura sight</i>, <i>cloud mind</i> (DC 15), <i>detect psionics</i>, <i>read thoughts</i> (DC 15); 3/day-<i>mental barrier</i> (2 rounds*), <i>metamorphosis</i>, <i>psionic plane shift</i>, <i>thought shield</i> (power resistance 19*). Manifester level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p><p>*Includes augmentation for the psionic couatl's manifester level.</p><p><b>Poison (Ex)</b>: Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial damage 2d4 Str, secondary damage 4d4 Str.</p><p>The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><b>Spells:</b> A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.</p><p>It can choose its spells known from the sorcerer list, the cleric list, and from the lists for the Air, Good, and Law domains. The cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.</p><p><i>Typical Spells Known</i> (6/7/7/7/4; save DC 13 + spell level): 0-<i>cure minor wounds</i>,  <i>daze</i>,  <i>disrupt undead</i>,  <i>light</i>,  <i>obscuring mist</i>,  <i>ray of frost</i>,  <i>read magic</i>,  <i>resistance</i>; 1st-<i>endure elements</i>,  <i>mage armor</i>,  <i>protection from chaos</i>,  <i>true strike</i>,  <i>wind wall</i>; 2nd-<i>cure moderate wounds</i>,  <i>eagle's splendor</i>,  <i>scorching ray</i>,  <i>silence</i>; 3rd-<i>gaseous form</i>,  <i>magic circle against evil</i>,  <i>summon monster III</i>; 4th- <i>charm monster</i>,  <i>freedom of movement</i>.</p><p><b>Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</b> This ability works like the <i>ethereal jaunt</i> spell (caster level 16th).</p><p><b>Telepathy (Su):</b> A couatl can communicate telepathically with any creature within 90 feet that has an Intelligence score. The creature can respond to the couatl if it wishes-no common language is needed.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.</p><p>The half-giant warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p><p><h3>Half-Giants as Characters</h3></p><p>Half-giant characters possess the following racial traits.</p><p/></new-text></monster>

  <new-text><p><h2>Puppeteer</h2></p><p>Puppeteers do not speak, though they can speak indirectly using a host body's vocal cords, in whatever language the host knows (usually Common).</p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p>Puppeteers use their psionic powers in conjunction with their enthrall ability to gain control over potential hosts. Once it is in control, a puppeteer almost exclusively relies on the host's mental and physical abilities, although it can use its own powers to enhance their effectiveness in a particularly dangerous situation.</p><p><b>Enthrall (Ex):</b> If a puppeteer is in physical contact with a person it has charmed (the puppeteer establishes a physical hold by means of slender infiltrating tendrils), the subject acts as if dominated.

A puppeteer that is attached to its host is treated as a creature in a grapple for the purpose of striking at the puppeteer instead of the host (but the host is not considered grappled in turn).</p><p><b>Telepathy (Su):</b> A puppeteer can communicate telepathically with any creature within 20 feet that has a language.</p><p/><p><h3>Puppeteer, Flesh Harrower</h3></p><p><h5>Combat</h5></p><p><b>Psi-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day-<i>concealing amorpha</i>, <i>hustle</i>, <i>mental barrier</i>; 1/day-<i>vigor</i> (+15 hp*).

The save DCs are Intelligence-based.</p><p><i>Typical Psion Powers Known</i> (power points 21, base save DC 12 + power level): 1st- <i>detect psionics</i>,  <i>empty mind</i>,  <i>mind thrust</i> (DC 13*), <i>psionic charm</i> (DC 13*); 2nd-<i>brain lock</i> (DC 14), <i>cloud mind</i> (DC 14), <i>energy push</i> (DC 14), <i>read thoughts</i> (DC 14).</p><p>*Power can be augmented.</p><p><b>Telekinetic Force (Su):</b> An unbodied can use <i>telekinetic force</i> (DC 15) as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Manifester level 4th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><b>Assume Likeness (Su):</b> An unbodied can assume the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Its abilities do not change, but it appears to be that creature, relying on its Bluff and Disguise skills to deflect suspicion.</p><p><b>Hide Mind (Su):</b> An unbodied cannot be identified as psionic by divination spells or clairsentience powers.</p><p><b>Incorporeal Traits:</b> An unbodied is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, powers, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> An unbodied has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. *When using its assume likeness ability, an unbodied gets an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If it can read an opponent's mind, it gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.</p><p><h3>Unbodied as Characters</h3></p><p>Unbodied characters possess the following racial traits.</p><p/></new-text></monster>
