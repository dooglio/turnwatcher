INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

For GNU/Linux distributions, download the tarball. Follow the instructions below:

    * Download the file to your local computer. We recommend downloading it in your
      home directory (/home/USER where USER is your user name).

    * Open a Unix shell (Terminal or Console). Make sure you are in your home directory.

    * Extract the files:

      $ tar -xzf turnwatcher_1.0-m2osw1.tar.gz

    * If your tar command doesn't understand the 'z' flag, use two commands
      like this:

      $ gunzip turnwatcher_1.0-m2osw1.tar.gz
      $ tar -xf turnwatcher_1.0-m2osw1.tar

    * Change directories into the turnwatcher folder.

      $ cd turnwatcher_1.0-m2osw1

    * Run the install script:

      $ ./install.sh

    * If the script can't figure out the pathname of your browser, it will ask
      you for the full path of your current browser.

    * Once finished, you can then run Turn Watcher!

      $ ./turnwatcher
