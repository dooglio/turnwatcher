<h2 align="center">Player HUD</h2>

<p id="para">
	Some Game Masters use a secondary monitor to show their players pictures of
	NPCs or the setting to add that extra dimension of realism to
	their campaigns. If you are one of those GMs, <b>Turn Watcher</b> now has a
	built-in player heads up display (or HUD for short).

	To activate the player HUD, go to the <i>View</i> menu and make sure "Show
	HUD Window" is checked. A new window will appear:
</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="../images/tw_player_hud.png" hspace="11" vspace="10"/>
</p>

<p id="para">
	Just drag the window over to the secondary monitor so it is visible to your
	players.  Right clicking on the panel allows you to adjust the font size for the HUD
	only. Just select the "Change font" menu to do so.
</p>

<p id="para">
	A new entry in the edit window allows you to enter a "public" name for the
	combatant. So for monsters, you can show the players one name, yet have 
	the real name concealed only for yourself to see.
	Note that effect counts on monsters are not visible to the players

	<b>Tip:</b>
	Use Ctrl-H to turn on or off the Player HUD.
