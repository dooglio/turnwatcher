<p id="menu_description">
	At the time the character or monster wants to act, he can jump in.
	Note that the last chance to jump in is when you reach the last
	character or monster in the list. After that, the delayed characters
	and monsters simply lose their turn on that round.

<p id="menu_description">
	A character or monster in delay mode is shown in a different color
	to let you know at a glace that it is delayed.
