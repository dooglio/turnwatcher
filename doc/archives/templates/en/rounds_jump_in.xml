	Use this command to have a character or monster jump back in combat.
	Only delayed characters and monsters can jump in. <b>Turn Watcher&#x2122;</b>
	automatically computes whose turn it is next. It is shown with
	a sword on the left of the character or monster name.
</p>
<p id="menu_description">
	When a character or monster wants to delay their attack, they need
	to speak up at the time their regular turn comes up. At that time
	you can click on Delay. At any time after that, the characters who
	were delayed can jump in.
</p>
<p id="menu_description">
	When only one character or monster is delayed, that one is the one
	jumping in. Otherwise a list of all the characters and monsters
	currently delayed appears and you need to select which one wants
	to jump in.

<p id="warning">
	Warning: Any character or monster who is delayed needs to jump in
	when you reach the last character or monster in the list (not
	including dead ones). If you click Next on the last character or
	monster, you go to the next round and the delayed characters lose
	their turn in this round.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Of course, if you inadvertendly click Next too many times, you
	can always use Ctrl-Z to come back.
