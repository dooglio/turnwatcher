<p id="menu_description">
	The Initiative is tedious to manage by hand especially when you have many
	players and even more monsters. The computer will not only roll the dice
	for you, it will list the players in the order they will fight in a round
	and the space bar will then get you from one character to the next in the
	correct order.
