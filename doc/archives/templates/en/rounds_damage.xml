<p id="menu_description">
	Whenever a character or monster is hit or healed, use the Damage option
	to enter the amount of hit points to withdraw or add. This command opens
	a dialog in which you can type the amount of damage. Put a negative
	value to heal the character (say a cleric casts a healing spell, he
	rolls a 1d8 and gets 3, put -3 in the damage dialog.)
