<p id="menu_description">
	After you hit <a href="#rounds_start">Start</a> and then Initiative,
	your characters and monsters are sorted in the order they will fight.
	Use this action to know who's turn it is. <b>Turn Watcher&#x2122;</b>
	shows whose turn it is with an arrow on the left of the character
	or monster name. Once everyone had a turn, <b>Turn Watcher&#x2122;</b>
	automatically rolls initiative for you and starts a new round.
