<p id="menu_description">
	As a Dungeon Master, it is often that you want to roll dice for a listen
	without having to tell your players. This option lets you do just that.
	A simple click or key stroke and you know whether one or more of your
	players could overhear these monsters conversation, the magic alarm, etc.
