<p id="menu_description">
	As a Dungeon Master, it is often that you want to roll dice for a spot
	without having to tell your players. This option lets you do just that.
	A simple click or key stroke and you know whether one or more of your
	players did spot some invisible monster, magical illusion, etc.
