agreement between you (either an individual or a single
entity) and Made to Order Software, Corporation (m2osw) for Turn Watcher, which
includes computer software and may include associated media, printed materials,
and "online" or electronic documentation ("Software Product"). The Software
Product also includes any updates and supplements to the original Software

licensed to you under the terms of that license agreement. By installing,
copying, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using the Software Product, you
agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of
this EULA, do not install or use the Software Product; you may, however, return
it to your place of purchase for a full refund.</p>

<h4>Software Product License</h4>

<p>The Software Product is protected
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other

		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Reservation of Rights.</b> All rights not expressly granted are reserved by m2osw.
		</li>

	</ol>

	<li><b>Description of Other Rights and Limitations.</b></li>

	<ol type="a">
		<li>
			<b>Not for Resale Software.</b> If the Software Product is
			labeled "Not For Resale" or "Demo Software", then, notwithstanding other
			sections of this EULA, your use of the Software Product is limited to use for
			demonstration, test, or evaluation purposes and you may not resell, or
			otherwise transfer for value, the Software Product.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly.</b> You

			and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable
			law notwithstanding this limitation.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Separation of Components.</b> The Software Product is
			licensed as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use
			on more than one Computer at a time. Some parts of the Software Product come
			from open source projects ("OSP"). The code and components of these OSP can be
			obtained separately and used freely notwithstanding this limitation.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Trademarks.</b> This EULA does not grant you any rights in
			connection with any trademarks or service marks of m2osw.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Rental.</b> This license does not grant you any right to
			rent, lease, or lend the Software Product. m2osw has other licenses available
			for this purpose.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Support Services.</b> m2osw may provide you with support
			services related to the Software Product ("Support Services"). Use of Support
			Services is governed by the m2osw policies and programs described in "online"
			documentation, and/or in other m2osw provided materials. Any supplemental
			software code provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be
			considered part of the Software Product and subject to the terms and conditions
			of this EULA unless the software code is part of an OSP, in which case it will
			have its own license. With respect to technical information you provide to
			m2osw as part of the Support Services, m2osw may use such information for its
			business purposes, including for product support and development. m2osw will
			not utilize such technical information in a form that personally identifies
			you.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Software Transfer.</b> The current licensee of the Software
			Product may make a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and Software
			Product to another user (either an individual or a single entity). This
			transfer must include all of the Software Product (including all component
			parts, the media, backup copies thereof, printed materials, any upgrades, and
			this EULA). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any other
			indirect transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must agree to
			comply with the terms of this EULA. The transferor must destroy all copies of
			the Software Product that cannot be transferred (such as, but not limited, to
			the copies on the transferor Computers) at the time the transfer occurs.
		</li>

		<li>
			<b>Termination.</b> Without prejudice to any other rights, m2osw
			may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of
			this EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the Software Product
			and all of its component parts.
		</li>

	</ol>

	<li><b>Upgrades.</b></li>

		<p>If the Software Product is labeled as an upgrade, you must be properly
		licensed to use a product identified by m2osw as being eligible for the
		upgrade in order to use the Software Product. A Software Product labeled
		as an upgrade replaces and/or supplements (and may disable) the product
		that formed the basis for your eligibility for the upgrade. You may use
		the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this
		EULA. If the Software Product is an upgrade of a component of a package of
		software programs that you licensed as a single product, the Software
		Product may be used and transferred only as part of that single product
		package and may not be separated for use on more than one Computer at a
		time.</p>

	<li><b>Copyright.</b></li>

		<p>All title and copyrights in and to the Software
		Product (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations,
		video, audio, music, text, and "extension modules" incorporated into the
		Software Product), the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the
		Software Product are owned by m2osw or its suppliers. All title and
		intellectual property rights in and to the content that may be accessed through

		form, you may print multiple copies of such electronic documentation for your
		own purpose. You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the Software
		Product.</p>

	<li><b>Software in Multiple Mediums.</b></li>

		<p>You may receive the Software Product in more than
		one medium. Regardless of the type or size of mediums you receive, you may use
		only one medium that is appropriate for the Computer on which you are currently
		Running the Software Product. You may not loan, rent, lease, or otherwise
		transfer the other mediums to another user, except as part of the permanent
		transfer (as provided above) of the Software Product.</p>

	<li><b>Backup Copies.</b></li>

		<p>You may keep
		the original media on which the Software Product was provided by m2osw solely
		for backup or archival purposes. You may make backup copies of the original
		media solely for backup or archival purposes. You will either destroy or
		transfer all of these copies as part of a permanent transfer (as provided
		above) of the Software Product. Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you
		may not otherwise make copies of the Software Product or the printed materials
		accompanying the Software Product.</p>

	<li><b>Export Restrictions.</b></li>

		<p>You agree that
		you will not export or re-export the Software Product, any part thereof, or any
		process or service that is the direct product of the Software Product (the
		foregoing collectively referred to as the "Restricted Components"), to any
		country, person or entity subject to U.S. export restrictions. You specifically
		agree not to export or re-export any of the Restricted Components (i) to any
		country to which the U.S. has embargoed or restricted the export of goods or
		services, which currently include, but are not necessarily limited to Cuba,
		Iran, Libya, North Korean, Sudan and Syria, or to any national of any such
		country, wherever located, who intends to transmit or transport the Restricted
		Components back to such country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or
		have reason to know will utilize the Restricted Components in the design,
		development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii)
		to any person or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S.
		export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant
		and represent that neither the BXA nor any other U.S. federal agency has
		suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges.</p>

	<li><b>No fault tolerant guarantee.</b></li>

		<p>The Software Product is not fault tolerant and is
		not designed, manufactured, or intended for use or resale as on-line control
		equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in
		the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication
		systems, air traffic control, in which the failure of our Software Product
		could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
		environmental damage.</p>

	<li><b>Laws governing the EULA.</b></li>

		<p>If you acquired this Software Product in the United
		States, this EULA is governed by the laws of the State of California. If this
		Software Product was acquired outside the United States, then local law may
		apply.</p>

	<li><b>Limited Warranty.</b></li>

		<p>m2osw warrants
		that (a) the Software Product will perform substantially in accordance with the
		accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days from the date
		of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided by m2osw shall be
		substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to you by
		m2osw, and m2osw support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts to
		solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow
		limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not
		apply to you. To the extent allowed by applicable law, implied warranties on
		the Software Product, if any, are limited to ninety (90) days.</p>

	<li><b>Customer Remedies.</b></li>

		<p>m2osw and its
		suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at m2osw
		option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or (b) repair or
		replacement of the Software Product that does not meet m2osw's limited warranty
		and which is returned to m2osw with a copy of your receipt. This Limited
		Warranty is void if failure of the Software Product has resulted from accident,
		abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement Software Product will be warranted
		for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
		whichever is longer. Outside the United States, neither these remedies nor any
		product Support Services offered by m2osw are available without proof of
		purchase from an authorized supplier.</p>

	<li><b>No Other Warranties.</b></li>

		<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
		m2osw and its suppliers disclaim all other warranties and conditions, either
		express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
		merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement,
		with regard to the software product, and the provision of or failure to provide
		Support Services. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You
		may have others, which vary from state/jurisdiction/country to
		state/jurisdiction/country.</p>

	<li><b>Limitations of Liability.</b></li>

		<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
		in no event shall m2osw or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
		indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,
		damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
		information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or
		inability to use the Software Product or the provision of or failure to provide
		Support Services, even if m2osw has been advised of the possibility of such
		damages. In any case, m2osw's entire liability under any provision of this EULA
		shall be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by your for the
		Software Product or U.S. $5.00; provided that if you have also entered into a
		different agreement with m2osw, the terms of that other agreement may prevail.
		Because some states, jurisdictions and countries do not allow the exclusion or
		limitation of liability, this limitation may not apply to you.</p>
